# NEXT TIME:
## Need to figure out how we're going to match regular expressions with a variable (in our case, a $path)
## Need to figure out how to handle those when the variable has a slash (ours will, since it's a path)
## Need to figure out how to handle converting that path into the title -- i.e. the `Craft` header has no markdown file -- it's just a blank header -- so it won't have the path in it
