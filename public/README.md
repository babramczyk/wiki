# My Wiki

My second brain ðŸ§ 

Where I take notes (both public and private), so that I can:

- Remember things that aren't important right now and I know I'll forgot
- Publish them online so that others can benefit from my research and learnings
- Easily create, query, and view notes using an Alfred workflow

> **Note:** These notes often go stale or unmaintained. Nothing in here what I believe -- either at the time of writing, or now. They are just data points that I once decided to write down (and may clean up at some point)
