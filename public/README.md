# My Wiki

My second brain ðŸ§ 

Where I take notes (both public and private), so that I can:

- Remember things that aren't important right now and I know I'll forgot
- Publish them online so that others can benefit from my research and learnings
- Easily create, query, and view notes using an Alfred workflow
