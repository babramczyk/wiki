## Things to do once we get there

* Go to bars to watch Tartot show on Sunday nights

## Notes

* Important to follow the rules
  * e.g. Always wait for traffic signal to cross the street. If you don't, people might yell/lecture at you
* Sense of humor
  * Stigma that they don't have one, but it's just different
  * Dry, very timely \(relates to the news of that week\)
* People do research before purchases
* Emphasis on the value of products vs. the marketing of them
* Be punctual
  * Even for a party, showing up more than 15 minutes late might be offensive
* Insurance
  * There's an insurance to cover legal fees, should you ever need it
  * There's "personal liability insurance" that is pretty standard -- covers you in the event that you do anything wrong \(i.e. break a friend's vase\)
* Customer service isn't great in Germany
* Work is a place for work
  * Shorter work week, but more efficient when there
  * Not much socializing at work
  * Germans focus on work at work, and party when it's time to party
* Work week is shorter -- 36-40 hours per week, 7-8 per day
* Hasselhoff is embarassing -- don't bring it up
* Make sure to use the correct version of Du vs. Sind
  * Can get fined if you call a police officer Du
  * Professionally and older people are generally Sind
