## Merino

- Wool clothes are expensive, and can be slightly more itchy than their synthetic and natural fiber counterparts. Companies try to reduce costs and itchiness by incorporating synthetic fibers into the fabric. In my experience, the higher the % of merino wool, the better it will perform. I would shoot for at least 85-90% wool, with 100% being the best.

- Full merino vs blend might be a little less durable
- Full merino vs blend is less stinky
- 100% merino gives you 100% of the benefits of merino (odour resistance, some water resistance, relatively quick dry compared to cotton, moisture management, etc) but also 100% of the negatives (limited durability, chiefly, but also v heavy when wet, can ages to dry when saturated) ([source](<https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/juljov/tshirt_and_base_layers_100_wool_vs_7030_woolsilk/#:~:text=100%25%20merino%20gives%20you%20100%25%20of%20the%20benefits%20of%20merino%20(odour%20resistance%2C%20some%20water%20resistance%2C%20relatively%20quick%20dry%20compared%20to%20cotton%2C%20moisture%20management%2C%20etc)%20but%20also%20100%25%20of%20the%20negatives%20(limited%20durability%2C%20chiefly%2C%20but%20also%20v%20heavy%20when%20wet%2C%20can%20ages%20to%20dry%20when%20saturated)>))

## Notes

- Pretty much everything that’s athletic and you’ll be sweating in **shouldn’t be cotton**
  - Rather, it should be something synthetic
    - Merino wool is tops
    - Otherwise, nylon or polyester (can be a blend)
