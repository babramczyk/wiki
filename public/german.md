## Notes

- [There is no difference between gern and gerne in meaning, and they are interchangeable in usage. The dictionary typically even lists them as "gern(e)" rather than as separate entries.](https://german.stackexchange.com/questions/4124/when-to-use-gern-vs-gerne)
- [The usage between the two is more of a feeling or the way it sounds in the sentence or circumstance rather than a grammatical requirement. Perhaps you want to say "gerne" to really emphasize something, or perhaps just "gern" with a sense of finality. As you become more familiar with German, you will get a better feel for its rhythm and rhyme and what sounds better to your ears. The choice is yours.](https://german.stackexchange.com/questions/4124/when-to-use-gern-vs-gerne)
