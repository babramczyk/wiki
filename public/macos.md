## Notes

* To focus the menu bar \(top left\), use `⌃f2`
* To focus the menu bar \(top right\), use `⌃f8`
* To focus the `Help` menu item in the menu bar \(and therefore the menu bar itself\), use `⌘⇧/`. This will let you query all menu items. Useful for when you want to know the keyboard shortcut for an item, or if an item doesn't have a shortcut at all
