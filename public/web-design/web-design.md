# Inspiring Designs

## Notes

- There's a bit of a curse when it comes to design: if you spend 4 hours building something, you lose all objective perception. It's impossible to tell if it's good or not. For this reason, I always step away from a project for a day or two after I have a rough design in place. When I come back, I'll be able to tell if it's good or not.

- An affordance is a property or feature of an object which presents a prompt on what can be done with this object. In short, affordances are cues which give a hint how users may interact with something, no matter physical or digital.
