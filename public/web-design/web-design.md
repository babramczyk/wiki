# Inspiring Designs

## Notes

- There's a bit of a curse when it comes to design: if you spend 4 hours building something, you lose all objective perception. It's impossible to tell if it's good or not. For this reason, I always step away from a project for a day or two after I have a rough design in place. When I come back, I'll be able to tell if it's good or not. ([source](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog/#:~:text=a%20bit%20of%20a%20curse%20when%20it%20comes%20to%20design)))
- An affordance is a property or feature of an object which presents a prompt on what can be done with this object. In short, affordances are cues which give a hint how users may interact with something, no matter physical or digital.

- Reading/column width: 65 characters (2.5 times the Roman alphabet) is often referred to as the perfect measure. Derived from this number is the ideal range that all designers should strive for: 45 to 75 characters (including spaces and punctuation) per line for print.
