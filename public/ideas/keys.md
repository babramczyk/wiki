# Keys

My idea for "keys" right now is this:

Sometimes, just knowing about something is the "key" to being able to advance in it. Once you hear about it, or even hear just a phrase, or a concept, or hear about something and realize it even exists, that alone is the **key** to the door of some significant advancement

## My Keys so far

  - Natively has Cocoa keybindings that mirror Emacs
- Karabiner-Elements, and being able to define OS-wide keyboard shortcuts

  - Skim books, read first and last chapter, read summaries, read reviews, listen to podcasts about the books
  - Fundamentally, the idea that we don't need to read things 100% of the way through -- just get the nuggets we're looking for
  - Also, there's some stat about successful entrepreneurs only reading like 10% of the books in their libraries (Bill Gates, Zuckerberg)
- Ephemerality of memory
  - There's some stat from psychology about loss of memory learning curve. Forget 75% within first 24 hours
