# Mosquitoes

## Notes

- Mosquitoes are attracted to certain compounds that are present on human skin and in **sweat**. These compounds give us a specific odor that can draw mosquitoes in.

- Body odor itself is determined by **genetics**. If you’re related to someone who is often bitten by mosquitoes, you may be more susceptible too.

- Research has shown that mosquitoes are attracted to the color black, but little is known about why. Regardless, if you’re wearing **black or other dark colors**, you may be more attractive to mosquitoes.

- A small 2002 study looked at the effects of alcohol consumption on attractiveness to mosquitoes. The researchers found that people who had consumed **beer** were **more attractive** to mosquitoes than people who had not.

- Studies have shown that mosquitoes appear to be **more attracted to pregnant women** than non-pregnant women. This may be because pregnant women have a high body temperature and exhale more carbon dioxide.

- Mosquitoes are drawn to **floral scented soaps, deodorants, perfumes, and moisturizing lotions**.

- They are also drawn to **smelly feet or socks** and your sweat or skin odor; and they will use these skin-derived chemical signals and smells to find you.

- If you have a **higher metabolic rate or warmer body temperature**, mosquitos will notice.

- Mosquitoes are attracted to the carbon dioxide you exhale as well as the lactic acid produced by exercise.

- Studies have found that if you have **Type O blood**, mosquitoes will be more interested in you.
