# Observability / Monitoring

## Notes

- Monitoring is the verb. You monitor your application
  - Observability is the property of the system; the ability to be observed
- No matter how great our monitoring smarts, they’ll count for little if folks don’t use them when designing, developing or testing their applications. Moreover, if a system can’t be applied in context of work being performed, it’ll just end up on the “too hard to use” shelf.

- Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability#:~:text=Observability%20is%20a%20measure%20of%20how%20well%20internal%20states%20of%20a%20system%20can%20be%20inferred%20from%20knowledge%20of%20its%20external%20outputs))
- Monitoring gives software teams instrumentation, which collects data about their systems and allows them to quickly respond when errors and issues occur. Observability, on the other hand, is the practice of instrumenting those systems with tools to gather actionable data that provides not only the when of an error or issue, but, more important, the why.

- Telemetry in software refers to the ethical and transparent collection of user and usage data from software usually over the internet while adhering to stringent security and privacy standards throughout the process.
