# Systems Design

## Notes

- A systems design interview is as much about communication with the interviewer ([source](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/system-design-interview-an-insiders-guide-review/#:~:text=a%20systems%20design%20interview%20is%20as%20much%20about%20communication%20with%20the%20interviewer))
- One thing you should avoid is "just memorizing" the approaches of the problems. ([source](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/system-design-interview-an-insiders-guide-review/#:~:text=one%20thing%20you%20should%20avoid%20is%20%22just%20memorizing%22%20the%20approaches%20of%20the%20problems.))
