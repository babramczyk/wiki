# HTML / CSS

## Notes

- [Chrome has a CSS Overview tab in the debugger](https://mobile.twitter.com/joshwcomeau/status/1289206431938301978)
- [HTML has a native progress element](https://mobile.twitter.com/joshwcomeau/status/1318301579125100557)
- `filter: drop-shadow` works just like box-shadow, but it applies to the element's contents. If that element is a .png or a .gif, it'll add the shadow to the non-transparent pixels in the image!
- [You can make any DOM element resizable like a with 1 line of CSS](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1314629346510991361)
- [You can add groovy wavy underlines using CSS! The `text-decoration` property actually takes 3 values](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1264323456302231553)
- [CSS `clamp` function. It lets you clamp a value between a min and max, _across units_](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1262529531417636866)
- Focus outlines are important for accessibility, but they can't be rounded. Simulate 'em with box-shadow! ([source](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1356741451405807616))
- [There's significant performance hit with nested CSS grids](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1356384886244839424)
  - Other than the nested case, though, don't worry about CSS Grid causing performance issues
