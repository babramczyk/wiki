# Macos

## Notes

- To focus the menu bar (top left), use `⌃f2`
- To focus the menu bar (top right), use `⌃f8`
- To focus the `Help` menu item in the menu bar (and therefore the menu bar itself), use `⌘⇧/`. This will let you query all menu items. Useful for when you want to know the keyboard shortcut for an item, or if an item doesn't have a shortcut at all
- To paste an image from the clipboard into the filesystem (from the command line), [use pngpaste util](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11100/whats-the-quickest-way-to-get-a-graphic-on-the-clipboard-saved-to-disk)
