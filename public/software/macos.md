## Notes

- To focus the menu bar (top left), use `⌃f2`
- To focus the menu bar (top right), use `⌃f8`
- To focus the `Help` menu item in the menu bar (and therefore the menu bar itself), use `⌘⇧/`. This will let you query all menu items. Useful for when you want to know the keyboard shortcut for an item, or if an item doesn't have a shortcut at all
