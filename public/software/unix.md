## Notes

- Awk, like Sed, is a programming language designed for dealing with large bodies of text. But while Sed is used to process and modify text, Awk is mostly used as a tool for analysis and reporting. ([source](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/sed-awk-learn/))
- Sed is for search and replace; Awk is for programatically handling and processing lines
