## AppleScript Advice

_Applescript is unfortunately not very well documented. I mostly learned by googling, dictionaries, and looking at unrelated scripts people have written. There's a paid app called Script Debugger which helped me out when I was new to it. One very handy command is "get properties of blah". For UI scripting the Xcode Accessibility Inspector is very useful._

### Logins

When signing up for a site, I'll try to follow these rules:

1. If it's coding related, use GitHub login
2. For everything else, use Google login
3. If neither of these are available, I'll use my typical email/username and a password
