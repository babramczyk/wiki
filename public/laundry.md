# Laundry

## Fabric Softener

* Fabric softener and dryer sheets basically add a coating of some material to the fabric
* That’s what makes it _feel_ “soft”
* This has the downside of ruining some clothing
  * DriFit
  * Some materials \(merino wool, for example, says don’t use fabric softener\)
* Basically, so long as you’re doing big general loads, don’t do it
* If you get to the point where you’re doing specialized loads, you could look into this again
  * But right now it’s not really worth the trouble

## Socks

* Wash inside out **if it’s sweaty and nasty in there**
  * Washing inside out helps wash the dirtiest, sweatiest parts better
  * But, I’ve seen it possibly tear some threads loose
  * And, sometimes the outside is the dirtiest \(dirt from the floor, etc.\)
  * So only do it if you really feel like the inside needs cleaning
* Hang dry if possible for soft socks you want to preserve
  * Helps preserve material
  * Friction and heat of the dryer break down the cotton/material
* For socks that aren’t a big deal \(athletic socks\), just tumble dry low
* Cold water
* Gentle/delicate loads
  * Prevents rubbing against other clothes
* No fabric softener
  * Reduces the sock's moisture wicking
* Use mild soap/detergent
* Don't fold
  * Helps them lose shape
* Buy high quality socks

## Jeans

* Wash infrequently — washing breaks down the material and fades the dye
* When you do wash, use delicate detergent
* If you need to use detergent, use bleach-free for dark colors \(like Woolite Dark\)
* Best option is to hand wash them
  * Soak in cold water and vinegar
  * If necessary, hand wash cycle with vinegar
  * Or, instead of vinegar, delicate detergent mentioned above
* No how water or heated dry
* Tumbling in dryer leads to wear and tear
* Otherwise, do it inside-out with like colors
  * Q: Should it be washed with other things?
* Q: Tumble dry low or hang dry? \(probably hang dry\)
* Can use Mr. Black’s spray to “freshen” them up without washing them completely
* Wearing a lot without washing them starts to stretch out the fabric
  * When you wash them next, they’ll probably be a bit more snug \(waist, calves\) for a few wears
* To help prevent fading, **stay out of sunlight** …😂

## Notes

* Underwear and socks need to be washed every time
  * But socks can go another round if you really didn’t sweat or anything — per-case basis
  * Underwear just go through a lot during the day — sweat and dead skin
  * Underwear also get stretched out throughout the day
  * Q: With new, nicer Mack Weldon underwear material, could we go two wears, or no?
* Merino wool
  * Wash after the first 2-3 wears
  * Q: How often to wash after that?
  * **Don’t tumble dry**
* In general, don’t tumble dry things you really want to preserve
  * Clothing breaks down from heat and friction in the dryer \(that’s where lint comes from\)
