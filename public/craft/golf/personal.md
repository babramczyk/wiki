# Golf (personal notes and improvements)

## Swing

Keep head still during swing

(then, check to see if right arm is more straight at contact)

(also check to see that your body is turning, with the weight shift hanging on the left leg and hip. There's an analogy where you're bracing to toss water in a bucket to your right side)

Also, keeping club face closed. This is accomplished pretty well by just thinking about keeping it closed, and not letting the club slip during the swing.

### Backlog

- Bringing left arm super far back
  - And also making the entire loop of the swing as wide as possible
  - Should help with distance
- Making right arm straight at contact and past contact

## Chipping/Pitching

Judging distance. You always go too far, because you instinctively aim for the pin vs the spot you want to drop the ball

### Putting

Committing to a line and distance, and keeping an eye on the ball after contact for a bit.

### Backlog

- Getting a tempo and ingraining it into muscle memory
  - It's not there yet at all, and it's very manual the way you try to make it happen
  - It needs to become natural, to the point where you can pick a backswing for your distance, and roll with it and trust it

## Backlog

- Faster/more set routines (addressing ball, aiming)
  - For every type of shot (swinging, putting, etc.)

## Equipment/Clubs

Some personal notes on what clubs are best for me (as of about 2020)

- Cavity back
- Heavier steel shaft (?)
- Regular flex
- Game improvement/cavity back
