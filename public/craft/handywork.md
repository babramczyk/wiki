### Tools necessary

- Hammer drill: For drilling a hole in the wall
- Plastic anchors: To anchor the screw
- Masonary bit: For drilling pilot hold with drill (1/4”). Measure shank of drill bit. It should be the same size or 1/16” bigger than the anchor. You should have trouble getting it into wall
