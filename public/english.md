Y'know, like the language.

## Notes

- Names and other proper nouns ending in y become plural simply by adding an s. They do not form their plurals with an apostrophe, or by changing the y to ies. ([source](https://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/apostro.asp#:~:text=Names%20and%20other%20proper%20nouns%20ending%20in%20y%20become%20plural%20simply%20by%20adding%20an%20s.%20They%20do%20not%20form%20their%20plurals%20with%20an%20apostrophe%2C%20or%20by%20changing%20the%20y%20to%20ies.))
- Awhile is an adverb that means "for a while," whereas "while" is a noun meaning "a period of time." Generally, you should use the two word form, "a while," when following a preposition (I will read for a while), or with the words ago or back (a while ago/back). The singular word "awhile" should be used to modify a verb (I will wait awhile) and can usually replace any usage of "for a while."
