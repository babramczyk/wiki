## Diversification

- Some go all BTC, some mix BTC/ETH
- A lot of people recommend researching and finding project you believe in
- Some people say diversification is more about getting one that goes viral, as opposed to protecting against losses ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/98kxxb/i_keep_hearing_diversify_your_portfolio_but_can/#:~:text=diversification%20isn't%20to%20protect%20you%20from%20losses.%20it's%20there%20to%20allow%20you%20to%20catch%20the%20moons.))
  - Many people say 65-85% in BTC, and say you don't need to diversify (or maybe shouldn't) to reduce risk
- The SAFEST crypto to invest in is BTC ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/cmift1/how_do_you_diversify_your_portfolio/#:~:text=The%20SAFEST%20crypto%20to%20invest%20in%20is%20BTC))
- Diversification is for the moment you already got big money. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/cmift1/how_do_you_diversify_your_portfolio/#:~:text=Diversification%20is%20for%20the%20moment%20you%20already%20got%20big%20money.)) (others said similar things)

## Notes

- The community consensus for long term holding is hardware wallets. The most popular ones are Ledger and Trezor which are both multi-coin wallets ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/l4298i/psa_to_newbies_coming_into_ethereum_and_bitcoin/#:~:text=The%20community%20consensus%20for%20long%20term%20holding%20is%20hardware%20wallets.%20The%20most%20popular%20ones%20are%20Ledger%20and%20Trezor%20which%20are%20both%20multi-coin%20wallets))
- In order to buy crypto, you need to use an exchange (e.g. Coinbase, Binance)
  - These exchanges provide security, 2FA, a place to trade crypto
  - Then, they charge you a fee
  - Also saw some online peer-to-peer exchanges I didn't look much into
- Some exchanges lock you in, which many people say is just like banks again (except less robust)
