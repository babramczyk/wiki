## Drinking Water Before Bed

**Rough consensus**: Stop drinking an hour or two before bed, don't chug but rather drink a moderate amount, drink warm water for a bonus

**What I'm going to do**: Drink warm water within 2 hours of sleeping, not chug before bed, stop drinking water 60 mins before sleep. Can adjust if I'm still waking up to pee.

- Dr. Michael Breus of The Sleep Doctor points out that we lose roughly 1 liter of water per night just from breathing ([source](https://laylasleep.com/drinking-water-before-bed/#:~:text=Dr.%20Michael%20Breus%20of%20The%20Sleep%20Doctor%20points%20out%20that%20we%20lose%20roughly%201%20liter%20of%20water%20per%20night%20just%20from%20breathing))
- A consensus that drinking water and staying hydrated throughout the _day_ is best
  - Lessens the need for water at night, which can wake you up to pee in the middle of the night

  - Aids digestion
- If you’re the type of sleeper who is always tossing and turning because you’re either freezing or overheating, having a glass of water before bed may help ([source](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/drinking-water-before-bed/#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99re%20the%20type%20of%20sleeper%20who%20is%20always%20tossing%20and%20turning%20because%20you%E2%80%99re%20either%20freezing%20or%20overheating%2C%20having%20a%20glass%20of%20water%20before%20bed%20may%20help))
- Consensus: If you were dehydrated during the day, it's pretty much always better to drink enough water at night -- even if that results in you having to wake up to pee
