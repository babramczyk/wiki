## Eating before early morning workout

Wanted to look this up, since I already strive to workout first thing in the morning. So I was curious on if I could/should be eating a little something before the exercise.

- Should try and avoid eating 60 minutes before workout, at least
  - But can try small amounts in under that period (often necessary, if workout is early enough)
- Some benefits to workout "fasting" (working out on empty stomach), but this is debated
  - Theory is that you teach the body to be more efficient with less fuel
- Regardless, there doesn't seem to be anything specifically wrong with working out right away in the morning on an empty stomach
- Highly individual

### What to eat before the workout

- Avoid high fat, high fiber, high protein
- But, get a small amount of carbs

#### Specific foods

- Banana
- Bread with jam
- Small amount of cereal or granola
- A few swigs of fruit juice
- Glass of chocolate milk
- Fruit smoothie
- Cup of yogurt
- Granola or protein bar
- Oatmeal w/ milk
- Hard-boiled egg
