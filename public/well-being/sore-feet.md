# Sore Feet

When having long days of walking and/or standing -- how to help with sore and fatigued feet?

## Notes

**tl;dr:** walk in everyday life a lot, try insoles, massage or ice feet, make sure you keep supportive shoes

- Icing your feet can reduce inflammation that causes soreness. Apply ice to sore feet by filling a plastic bag with ice or rolling your feet on a frozen water bottle. Try to ice the affected area for 5 to 15 minutes a few times a day to help reduce inflammation.

- Your feet can change in size during your lifetime (even when youâ€™re an adult) because they can spread out over time.

- Your sneakers may wear out after 400 or 500 miles and no longer provide the support you need. ([source](https://www.healthline.com/health/sore-feet-remedies#:~:text=your%20sneakers%20may%20wear%20out%20after%20400%20or%20500%20miles%20and%20no%20longer%20provide%20the%20support%20you%20need.))
- Arch supports, or orthotics, can keep your feet stable while standing or walking, eliminating pain.
