# Social Bonding

## Notes from Huberman podcast on social bonding

- Introverts aren't "quiet", they just release dopamine quicker from social interaction and therefore are satisfied quicker than extroverts
- The neurological pathway for cravings are often shared. i.e. physical hunger and social hunger. If you’re not getting enough social interaction, you might seek out food for the dopamine release you’re looking for
- It all comes down to dopamine. Dopamine is the one responsible for moving us towards these behaviors if we need them. The body is trying to get us back to homeostasis
- Social hunger is a healthy hunger
- Social hierarchies change depending on the situation we’re in. It’s plastic. i.e. friends having different roles in different situations
- When in love, it can decrease our other cravings, like for food and sleep
- Oxytocin is the hormonal glue that binds people together. Released in males 30 minutes after orgasm. Released in females during sexual stimulation and orgasm. Associated with honesty
- Two types of bonding: emotional/autonomic and rational/cognitive. Can have one or both of these to be bonded with someone.
- Two types of empathy: emotional empathy and cognitive empathy. Strongest bonds come with empathy?

### Social isolation

- Being socially isolated, in the relative short term, can a person more aggressive and irritable
- Loneliness is subjective, and defined by the person not getting the social interaction they expect
- If a person is chronically isolated, they can become more introverted
