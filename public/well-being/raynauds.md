# Raynaud’s

I suffer (that's too strong of a word, but whatever) from a "disease" called "Raynaud's Syndrome". That means my circulation can be really bad sometimes to my feet and hands, causing them to be super cold and sometimes numb. This can even be caused by being in an airconditioned room.

## Notes

- “Treatable by a medical professional”
- Can last for years, or a life time
- Fingers white when blood flow cut off, blue when low oxygen, red when blood returns
- Maybe see a doctor
- Doctors don’t completely understand what triggers attacks. Mostly cold
- Emotional stress can be a trigger
- Over time, the arteries that narrow can thicken slightly, further limiting blood flow
- Secondary Raynaud’s linked to rheumatoid arthritis
- Might have to get a blood test
- Home remedies
  - Avoid smoke
  - Exercise
  - Control stress
- Controlling an attack
  - Get indoors to warm area
  - Wiggle fingers and toes
  - Fingers in armpits
  - Wide circles with arms
  - Warm water
  - Massage hands and feet
- Alternative medicine
  - Fish oil (improve cold tolerance)
  - Ginkgo (decrease number of attacks)
  - Acupuncture (improve blood flow)
- Doctor: practitioner, or specialist (rheumatologist)
- Why a doctor?
  - Identify underlying condition
  - Info on minimizing frequency
- Channel blockers as a medication
- Biofeedback: Imagining at a warm room or beach to increase circulation. This trains the blood vessels to have this response automatically with time
- **Probably have primary raynaud’s**
- **2002 study on Ginkgo Biloba saw reduction in attacks by 56% (compared to 27% for placebo)**
- General practitioner, or rheumatologist
