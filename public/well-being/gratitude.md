# Gratitude

## Huberman protocol

- Practice has to be grounded in a narrative (i.e. a story)
  - Don’t have to hear that story every time you practice. Just have to know of the story
  - The story has to be either:
    - You receiving genuine thanks
    - You observing someone else receiving thanks or expressing thanks. Genuinely
- After establishing story, write down 3 or 4 simple bullet points
  - That can serve as salient reminders of that story
  - Serves as a cue, without having to hear entire story
  - Write down state of person before receiving gratitude
  - Write down state of person after receiving gratitude
  - Any other elements that add more emotional weight to the story
- Practice:
  - Read off these bullet points as a cue to your central nervous system for this sense of gratitude
  - 1-5 minutes: “Really feel into the experience”
- 3 times per week
- Time of day doesn’t matter
