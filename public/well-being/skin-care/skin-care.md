# Skin Care

### Other things I could do

I could add things like toner, exfoliant, and serums, but my impression as of right now is that they're mostly cosmetic or don't apply to my skin type, so it's not worth it.

## Notes

- After a shower, PAT your face dry, don't wipe or rub it with a towel ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/73pimh/im_currently_22_what_should_i_start_doingstop/dns7hnb/))
- Don't touch your face, or try to touch it as little as possible. Your hands have a LOT of oils all over them, and touching your face transfers it to your skin. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/73pimh/im_currently_22_what_should_i_start_doingstop/dns7hnb/))
- Regularly clean your pillowcase ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/73pimh/im_currently_22_what_should_i_start_doingstop/dns7hnb/))
- Exercise, less alcohol, more sleep
- Rinse with warm water, because hot water removes natural oils and causes your skin to become dehydrated ([source](https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/do-you-really-need-a-skin-care-routine))
- Morning skin care should focus on prevention and protection for the day and your nighttime routine should focus on cleansing and repair. ([source](https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/do-you-really-need-a-skin-care-routine))
- The only reason you really need to moisturize is after cleansing your skin
  - When you do that, you strip it of natural oils, so you need to replenish them
  - Otherwise, the body is perfectly capable of providing enough moisture for your skin (unless you have extremely dry skin)
