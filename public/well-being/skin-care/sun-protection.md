# Sun Protection

## Notes

- There are two types of UV rays: UVA rays and UVB rays," Dr. Nichols says. "The shorter UVB rays are what causes sunburns, and they dwindle in the colder months as they are less able to cut through clouds and reach the Earth’s surface. However, the longer UVA rays persist all year, and actually penetrate deeper into the skin to cause the dark spots and wrinkles associated with sun damage. By continuing to wear your SPF all year round, you’ll protect your skin and more effectively prevent common signs of aging.

- The effectiveness of a base tan has been studied before, and it only offers SPF of 3 or less. That is an incredibly low level of protection. Therefore, dermatologists recommend using sunscreen as sun protection and not base tanning. ([source](https://news.utexas.edu/2018/06/06/how-much-spf-do-you-need-in-your-sunscreen/))
- You should apply 1 shot glass full (about 1 to 1.5 ounces) of sunscreen to cover your entire body. This works out to about a teaspoon for your face and 1 teaspoon for each arm/hand. ([source](https://news.utexas.edu/2018/06/06/how-much-spf-do-you-need-in-your-sunscreen/))
  - An ounce of sunscreen is about as much as you can hold in your palm
  - For the face, two fingers full. Meaning a strip of cream down your index and middle finger
- Creams, lotions and sprays are equally as effective in theory. However, in practice it’s a different story. In the real world, people tend to apply spray sunscreen as if its “spray and walk away” cologne. As a result, people get less protection. As a rule, you should spray five seconds’ worth of sunscreen on each general body part, then rub it in so that you get adequate protection.

- Remember to put sunscreen on your ears! Skin cancer on the ears can be more difficult to treat and require surgery that, depending on the location, can leave the ears looking like they have been nibbled on. The lips are also susceptible to UV damage, so always look for lip balm containing SPF 30. ([source](https://news.utexas.edu/2018/06/06/how-much-spf-do-you-need-in-your-sunscreen/))
- most people do not apply a thick enough layer, so their SPF 30 may be more like an SPF 20. I usually recommend patients use an SPF 50+ so that they are covered if they do not apply their sunscreen very well.

- Get "broad spectrum" suncreens. These protect against both UVA and UVB rays
- UVB rays are responsible for producing sunburn. The UVB rays also play the greatest role in causing skin cancers, including the deadly black mole form of skin cancer (malignant melanoma). ([source](https://uihc.org/health-topics/what-difference-between-uva-and-uvb-rays))
- UVA rays also play a role in skin cancer formation. In addition, the UVA rays penetrate more deeply into the skin and play a greater role in premature skin aging changes including wrinkle formation (photoaging). There are approximately 500 times more UVA rays in sunlight than UVB rays. ([source](https://uihc.org/health-topics/what-difference-between-uva-and-uvb-rays))
- Reapply every two hours, or immediately after being in the water
- Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States and worldwide. 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer by the age of 70. ([source](https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/skin-cancer-facts/))
- When detected early, the 5-year survival rate for melanoma is 99 percent. ([source](https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/skin-cancer-facts/)) (Melanoma is the most common and fatal form of skin cancer)
- Apply extra SPF to freckles or dark spots — they're signs of sun damage. ([source](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a28855/anti-sun-shaming-feature/))
- While being bronzed does give you some level of protection, it’s only the equivalent of SPF 4 at best ([source](https://greatist.com/health/how-to-tan-safely#_noHeaderPrefixedContent))
- There is no such thing as a safe tan. The increase in skin pigment, called melanin, which causes the tan color change in your skin is a sign of damage. ([source](https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/tanning/risks-tanning#2))

  - Reapplication time is highly variable, and depends on a lot of things
  - 2 things that can degrade sunscreen: UV radiation and physical
    - UV: Spending time in sun
    - Physical: Touching face with hands, dirt, wind, hair, clothes, tissue, pillow
  - Some sunscreens are more organic, have better "half lives", so they last longer
    - If half life is poor, it degrades very quickly, and mostly from UV radiation
- In short: Yes, you should wear sunscreen every day. If you don't do so, says Manno, "You're going to accumulate damage in the skin, which can lead to developing cancerous skin lesions later in life."

- Sun damage can lead to wrinkles, uneven skin tone, loss of firmness, and aging signs ([source](https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/do-you-really-need-a-skin-care-routine))
- Elbuluk noted that leaving residual makeup, dirt and/or oil behind makes it hard for products like sunscreen to be effective. “Those products can’t penetrate as well if your skin isn’t clean because you have a coat of something on it,” she said. “You decrease the efficacy of those things.” ([source](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-often-wash-face_l_5e7e07b6c5b661492265f7f6#:~:text=elbuluk%20noted%20that%20leaving%20residual%20makeup%2C%20dirt%20and%2For%20oil%20behind%20makes%20it%20hard%20for%20products%20like%20sunscreen%20to%20be%20effective.%20%E2%80%9Cthose%20products%20can%E2%80%99t%20penetrate%20as%20well%20if%20your%20skin%20isn%E2%80%99t%20clean%20because%20you%20have%20a%20coat%20of%20something%20on%20it%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said.%20%E2%80%9Cyou%20decrease%20the%20efficacy%20of%20those%20things.%E2%80%9D))
