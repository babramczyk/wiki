# Exercise

## From the Huberman Labs podcast

- Peak times for workout (to optimize performance, minimize injury)
  - 30min after waking
  - 3hrs after waking
  - 11hrs after waking
  - But, shouldn't be the end-all-be-all -- still exercise when you can
- Studies around aerobic exercise vs anaerobic is hard, since you can't get mice to lift weights
- Intense workouts late in the day can negatively affect ability to fall asleep
  - In some cases, sleeping same amount but feeling more tired means exercise in the past few days too intense
- After a few days exercising at same time in morning, body will start to "itch" to wake up at the time and exercise
  - (based on neuroplasticity)
- After a few days of exercising at the same times, body will secrete hormones around those times to encourage exercise
