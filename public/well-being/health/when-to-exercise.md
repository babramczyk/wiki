# When to exercise

To answer the question "are there optimal times (in the day, or relative to other activities) to exercise?".

## Walking post- or pre-meal

- One more thing to completely avoid post dinner is working out. It not only affects our digestion but also postpone our sleep time.

- go for a brisk walk or indulge in any form of workout half an hour prior to your meal. It takes a lot of energy from our body and leaves it with ample room for the energy to be restored after a sumptuous meal. This drastically reduces the chances of your food getting converted into fat as the food we consume is used by the body for energy. In simple terms, working out before meal amplifies your bodyâ€™s metabolism which leads to better burn up of calories once we consume and digest our food.
