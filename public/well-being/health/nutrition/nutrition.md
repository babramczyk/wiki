  - But, liquid goes down gullet faster, so body doesn't register the calories being eaten as much as if the foods were still whole
  - And, when eating whole fruit, you have the barrier and registration of chewing the food -- which slows you down and makes you eat less
  - So, it doesn't reduce fiber, but you may end up consuming more calories in a smoothie than you would for whole fruit
- Our bodies absorb blended-fruit sugars differently than sugars from whole fruit ([source](https://www.motherjones.com/food/2016/03/are-smoothies-devil/#:~:text=our%20bodies%20absorb%20blended-fruit%20sugars%20differently%20than%20sugars%20from%20whole%20fruit)) 
  - Basically, argument that sugar from smoothies is digested quicker, which can overwhelm liver
- Chewing is good for us. Ancestors chewed 4 hours per day

## Notes

- Getting agitated when hungry is body's way of getting you to "forage" for food
- After a few days of eating at the same times, body will secrete hormones around those times to encourage eating
