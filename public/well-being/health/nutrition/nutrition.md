## Smoothies

- Doesn't really remove the fiber
  - But, liquid goes down gullet faster, so body doesn't register the calories being eaten as much as if the foods were still whole
  - And, when eating whole fruit, you have the barrier and registration of chewing the food -- which slows you down and makes you eat less
  - So, it doesn't reduce fiber, but you may end up consuming more calories in a smoothie than you would for whole fruit
- Our bodies absorb blended-fruit sugars differently than sugars from whole fruit ([source](https://www.motherjones.com/food/2016/03/are-smoothies-devil/#:~:text=our%20bodies%20absorb%20blended-fruit%20sugars%20differently%20than%20sugars%20from%20whole%20fruit)) 
  - Basically, argument that sugar from smoothies is digested quicker, which can overwhelm liver
- Chewing is good for us. Ancestors chewed 4 hours per day

## Notes

- Getting agitated when hungry is body's way of getting you to "forage" for food
- After a few days of eating at the same times, body will secrete hormones around those times to encourage eating
- David Sinclair: Avoid red meat -- contributes to heart disease
- It’s true that minimally processed sweeteners, like honey or maple syrup, contain more nutrients than highly processed ones, like white sugar. But the amounts of these nutrients are teeny tiny, so they probably won’t have a measurable impact on your health. To your body, all sources of sugar are the same.

- The U.S. Dietary Guidelines say that an adult eating 2,000 calories per day should have less than 12.5 teaspoons, or 50 grams, of added sugar daily. (That’s roughly the amount in a 16-ounce cola.) But the American Heart AssociationTrusted Source says women should have less than 6 teaspoons (25 grams), and men should have less than 9 teaspoons (36 grams) per day.
