## Smoothies

- Doesn't really remove the fiber
  - But, liquid goes down gullet faster, so body doesn't register the calories being eaten as much as if the foods were still whole
  - And, when eating whole fruit, you have the barrier and registration of chewing the food -- which slows you down and makes you eat less
  - So, it doesn't reduce fiber, but you may end up consuming more calories in a smoothie than you would for whole fruit
- Our bodies absorb blended-fruit sugars differently than sugars from whole fruit ([source](https://www.motherjones.com/food/2016/03/are-smoothies-devil/#:~:text=our%20bodies%20absorb%20blended-fruit%20sugars%20differently%20than%20sugars%20from%20whole%20fruit))
  - Basically, argument that sugar from smoothies is digested quicker, which can overwhelm liver
- Chewing is good for us. Ancestors chewed 4 hours per day

## Notes

- Getting agitated when hungry is body's way of getting you to "forage" for food
- After a few days of eating at the same times, body will secrete hormones around those times to encourage eating

- It’s true that minimally processed sweeteners, like honey or maple syrup, contain more nutrients than highly processed ones, like white sugar. But the amounts of these nutrients are teeny tiny, so they probably won’t have a measurable impact on your health. To your body, all sources of sugar are the same.

- The U.S. Dietary Guidelines say that an adult eating 2,000 calories per day should have less than 12.5 teaspoons, or 50 grams, of added sugar daily. (That’s roughly the amount in a 16-ounce cola.) But the American Heart AssociationTrusted Source says women should have less than 6 teaspoons (25 grams), and men should have less than 9 teaspoons (36 grams) per day.

- A recent study found that appetite-suppressing hormones decreased and hunger hormones increased when people ate processed foods, thus causing people to eat more. Is it a coincidence ultra-processed foods fail to induce our appetite-suppressing hormones, causing us to eat more, or is it a design?

- Eating carbs earlier in the meal, on their own, will lead to you wanting to eat more (source: Huberman)
  - Spikes blood glucose levels, makes you want to have more glucose
  - On the other hand, eating fibrous foods first (or combined with carbs) will lead to satiety earlier
  - e.g. the bread they put out at restaurants will ultimately make you want to eat more (in total)
- Turmeric helps with inflammation, but a lot is heavily contaminated with lead [source: 1:08:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0hZnn7rEmWTxLaB4l5xWXg?context=spotify%3Auser%3A1242916202%3Acollection%3Ayour-episodes&dl_branch=1&si=rxE49r4iQ2CEXTo3dlSP7A)
  - The lead is used to get the rich orange color
  - So check your sources of turmeric
  - For men in particular, can be antagonistic to DHT (involved in aggression, libido)
