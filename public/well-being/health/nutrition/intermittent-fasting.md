- I do mine opposite of most. I prefer to eat my calories first thing in the morning and let them digest and burn off throughout the day. I skip lunch and dinner. Works better for me and I sleep alot better I've found out as well.

- There is no evidence to back up that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, nutritionally all of your meals are as important. That saying is just good marketing to sell more cereal.

- As other commentators have stated, many of the studies which try to prove that breakfast is good for us are flawed for two reasons: Firstly, they are nearly always funded by Kelloggs or similar, and secondly, they are based on correlation and not causation.
