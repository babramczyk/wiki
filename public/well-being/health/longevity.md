# Longevity

## How long will we live?

Some research points to a maxing out point 12-150, but science is crazy and could be exponential so who knows.

- Humans may be able to live for between 120 and 150 years, but no longer than this "absolute limit" on human life span, a new study suggests. ([source](https://www.livescience.com/human-life-span-limit-150-found.html#:~:text=humans%20may%20be%20able%20to%20live%20for%20between%20120%20and%20150%20years%2C%20but%20no%20longer%20than%20this%20%22absolute%20limit%22%20on%20human%20life%20span%2C%20a%20new%20study%20suggests.))
- Life expectancy numbers from the past are a bit skewed because we keep kids below the age of 5 alive a lot better than they did in the 1800s and 1500s. Once you look at life expectancy past 5yo and remove things like accidents, the life expectancy numbers look VERY similar, especially if you only focus on the wealthy of those times.

## Notes

- Having Neanderthal genes in you helps protect you from heart disease (source: David Sinclair on Joe Rogan podcast)
- He states that eating one meal a day can extend your lifespan, which he has been doing. Plus, he tries his best to avoid snacking, too. ([source](https://www.mealprep.com.au/p/david-sinclair-joe-rogan-podcast/#:~:text=eating.-,He%20states%20that%20eating,To,-explain))
- Overconsumption can make your body complacent. At the molecular level, longevity genes respond to what you’re eating and how much you’re eating. These genes give our bodies resilience and slow down the biological clock. By letting your body experience some form of hunger, you can turn these genes on.

- Feeling constantly anxious, worried, and tense leads to or bad and chronic stress, speeding up the biological aging process.

- What diet slows epigenetic aging? New study shows a higher intake of veggies, fruits, nuts, legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy & lower intake of red & processed meat, & sugary beverages ([source](https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1407367588968124421?lang=en#:~:text=what%20diet%20slows%20epigenetic%20aging%3F%20new%20study%20shows%20a%20higher%20intake%20of%20veggies%2C%20fruits%2C%20nuts%2C%20legumes%2C%20whole%20grains%2C%20low-fat%20dairy%20%26%20lower%20intake%20of%20red%20%26%20processed%20meat%2C%20%26%20sugary%20beverages))
- Becoming inactive after being fit has about the same mortality risk as having never exercised. But it's never too late in life to start. Two hours a week is enough. (source: David Sinclair)
