# Longevity

## How long will we live?

Some research points to a maxing out point 12-150, but science is crazy and could be exponential so who knows.

- Humans may be able to live for between 120 and 150 years, but no longer than this "absolute limit" on human life span, a new study suggests. ([source](https://www.livescience.com/human-life-span-limit-150-found.html#:~:text=humans%20may%20be%20able%20to%20live%20for%20between%20120%20and%20150%20years%2C%20but%20no%20longer%20than%20this%20%22absolute%20limit%22%20on%20human%20life%20span%2C%20a%20new%20study%20suggests.))
- Life expectancy numbers from the past are a bit skewed because we keep kids below the age of 5 alive a lot better than they did in the 1800s and 1500s. Once you look at life expectancy past 5yo and remove things like accidents, the life expectancy numbers look VERY similar, especially if you only focus on the wealthy of those times.

## Supplements

Supplements widely used by those at the forefront of anti-aging:

- NMN
- Metformin
- Resveratrol

## Metformin

- Indeed, in the case of metformin, there can be rare and serious side-effects — including a condition called lactic acidosis, which can come with serious damage to people’s livers and kidneys. The most common side effect, though, is stomach discomfort.

- In mice, even a very low dose of metformin has been shown to increase lifespan by nearly 6 percent, though some have argued that the effect is due mostly to weight loss. Either way, that could amount to years of extra healthy years for humans, with an emphasis on healthy—the mice showed reduced LDL and cholesterol levels and improved physical performance. As the years have gone by, the evidence has mounted. In twenty-six studies of rodents treated with metformin, twenty-five showed protection from cancer.

- Since then, the evidence has grown that metformin may have beneficial effects in humans that go well beyond its long-time role in diabetes control and cancer prevention. ([source](https://lifespanbook.com/metformin-pill/?utm_source=Lifespan+Book&utm_campaign=90660ccd8b-third_email_metformin&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_82e2167267-90660ccd8b-158492430#:~:text=since%20then%2C%20the%20evidence%20has%20grown%20that%20metformin%20may%20have%20beneficial%20effects%20in%20humans%20that%20go%20well%20beyond%20its%20long-time%20role%20in%20diabetes%20control%20and%20cancer%20prevention.))
- A study of more than 41,000 metformin users between the ages of 68 and 81 concluded that metformin reduced the likelihood of dementia, cardiovascular disease, cancer, frailty, and depression, and not by a small amount. ([source](https://lifespanbook.com/metformin-pill/?utm_source=Lifespan+Book&utm_campaign=90660ccd8b-third_email_metformin&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_82e2167267-90660ccd8b-158492430#:~:text=a%20study%20of%20more%20than%2041%2C000%20metformin%20users%20between%20the%20ages%20of%2068%20and%2081%20concluded%20that%20metformin%20reduced%20the%20likelihood%20of%20dementia%2C%20cardiovascular%20disease%2C%20cancer%2C%20frailty%2C%20and%20depression%2C%20and%20not%20by%20a%20small%20amount.))
- Though not all cancers are suppressed––prostate, bladder, renal, and esophageal cancer seem recalcitrant––more than twenty-five studies have shown a powerful protective effect, sometimes as great as a 40 percent lower risk, most notably for lung, colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer. ([source](https://lifespanbook.com/metformin-pill/?utm_source=Lifespan+Book&utm_campaign=90660ccd8b-third_email_metformin&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_82e2167267-90660ccd8b-158492430#:~:text=though%20not%20all%20cancers%20are%20suppressed%E2%80%93%E2%80%93prostate%2C%20bladder%2C%20renal%2C%20and%20esophageal%20cancer%20seem%20recalcitrant%E2%80%93%E2%80%93more%20than%20twenty-five%20studies%20have%20shown%20a%20powerful%20protective%20effect%2C%20sometimes%20as%20great%20as%20a%2040%20percent%20lower%20risk%2C%20most%20notably%20for%20lung%2C%20colorectal%2C%20pancreatic%2C%20and%20breast%20cancer.))
- The biological programs impacted by metformin may exist significantly upstream of the conditions it impacts. Indeed, metformin might not work on diabetes and dementia, or even both – it might work on aging itself, which is the single biggest risk factor for both of these diseases. If that is the case, it is not unlikely that future studies will continue to demonstrate an effect on other age-aggravated diseases.

## Notes

- Having Neanderthal genes in you helps protect you from heart disease (source: David Sinclair on Joe Rogan podcast)
- He states that eating one meal a day can extend your lifespan, which he has been doing. Plus, he tries his best to avoid snacking, too. ([source](https://www.mealprep.com.au/p/david-sinclair-joe-rogan-podcast/#:~:text=eating.-,He%20states%20that%20eating,To,-explain))
- Overconsumption can make your body complacent. At the molecular level, longevity genes respond to what you’re eating and how much you’re eating. These genes give our bodies resilience and slow down the biological clock. By letting your body experience some form of hunger, you can turn these genes on. ([source](https://www.mealprep.com.au/p/david-sinclair-joe-rogan-podcast/#:~:text=overconsumption,on.))
- Your genes only control 20% of your ultimate age in old age. 80% is in your hands. ([source](https://www.mealprep.com.au/p/david-sinclair-joe-rogan-podcast/#:~:text=your%20genes%20only%20control%2020%25%20of%20your%20ultimate%20age%20in%20old%20age.%2080%25%20is%20in%20your%20hands.))
- The 5 best things you can do for yourself are exercising, eating healthily, getting adequate sleep, avoiding tobacco, and managing stress.

- Feeling constantly anxious, worried, and tense leads to or bad and chronic stress, speeding up the biological aging process.

- What diet slows epigenetic aging? New study shows a higher intake of veggies, fruits, nuts, legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy & lower intake of red & processed meat, & sugary beverages ([source](https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1407367588968124421?lang=en#:~:text=what%20diet%20slows%20epigenetic%20aging%3F%20new%20study%20shows%20a%20higher%20intake%20of%20veggies%2C%20fruits%2C%20nuts%2C%20legumes%2C%20whole%20grains%2C%20low-fat%20dairy%20%26%20lower%20intake%20of%20red%20%26%20processed%20meat%2C%20%26%20sugary%20beverages))
- Becoming inactive after being fit has about the same mortality risk as having never exercised. But it's never too late in life to start. Two hours a week is enough. (source: David Sinclair)
- A recent study of 14.5K people showed that even if you start exercising mid-life there are major benefits to longevity (24% reduction in death by all causes) and if you ramp up your existing program, even better (42%). ([source](https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/keeping-active-or-becoming-more-active-in-middle-and-older-age-linked-to-longer-life/?utm_source=Lifespan+Book&utm_campaign=90660ccd8b-third_email_metformin&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_82e2167267-90660ccd8b-158492430))
- A recent study found that appetite-suppressing hormones decreased and hunger hormones increased when people ate processed foods, thus causing people to eat more. Is it a coincidence ultra-processed foods fail to induce our appetite-suppressing hormones, causing us to eat more, or is it a design? ([source](https://lifespanbook.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=098ce37efe272f8cafd210d04&id=62376d0df4&e=fbe6064944))
- Quinine, a chemical in gin and tonics, seems to activate SIRT1, a longevity enzyme. Levels of the bitter substance in tonic water are not the same as 100 years ago when it was used against malaria, but that won't stop me using this new finding as an excuse.
