## How long will we live?

Some research points to a maxing out point 12-150, but science is crazy and could be exponential so who knows.

- Humans may be able to live for between 120 and 150 years, but no longer than this "absolute limit" on human life span, a new study suggests. ([source](https://www.livescience.com/human-life-span-limit-150-found.html#:~:text=humans%20may%20be%20able%20to%20live%20for%20between%20120%20and%20150%20years%2C%20but%20no%20longer%20than%20this%20%22absolute%20limit%22%20on%20human%20life%20span%2C%20a%20new%20study%20suggests.))
- Life expectancy numbers from the past are a bit skewed because we keep kids below the age of 5 alive a lot better than they did in the 1800s and 1500s. Once you look at life expectancy past 5yo and remove things like accidents, the life expectancy numbers look VERY similar, especially if you only focus on the wealthy of those times.
