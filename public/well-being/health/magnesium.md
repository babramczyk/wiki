- It's important to note that if people take magnesium supplements, they should not consume more than the recommended amount, which is 350 milligrams per day for adults.

- Recommended daily allowance: 400mg (Men 19-30)
- You can certainly get enough magnesium through diet alone ([source](https://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/johannah-sakimura-nutrition-sleuth/magnesium-why-youre-probably-not-getting-enough/#:~:text=you%20can%20certainly%20get%20enough%20magnesium%20through%20diet%20alone))
- Because magnesium is plentiful in plant foods, including nuts, beans, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, focusing on eating more of these foods or a plant-based diet will get you to your goal, says Moreno.

- Symptoms such as fatigue or weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting are possible signs that you aren’t getting enough of the mineral, she says.

- Dig into yogurt for breakfast. One cup of plain low-fat yogurt offers 42 mg of magnesium, 10 percent of the daily value (DV), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

- To date, there is no simple and accurate laboratory test to determine the total body magnesium status in humans. ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/#:~:text=to%20date%2C%20there%20is%20no%20simple%20and%20accurate%20laboratory%20test%20to%20determine%20the%20total%20body%20magnesium%20status%20in%20humans.))
- Mg is essential in the metabolism of vitamin D, and taking large doses of vitamin D can induce severe depletion of Mg. ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/#:~:text=mg%20is%20essential%20in%20the%20metabolism%20of%20vitamin%20d%2C%20and%20taking%20large%20doses%20of%20vitamin%20d%20can%20induce%20severe%20depletion%20of%20mg.))
- Adequate magnesium supplementation should be considered as an important aspect of vitamin D therapy. ([source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28471760/#:~:text=adequate%20magnesium%20supplementation%20should%20be%20considered%20as%20an%20important%20aspect%20of%20vitamin%20d%20therapy.))
- It’s also claimed that magnesium supplementation increases vitamin D levels in people who are deficient in the vitamin, but causes a reduction in people whose intake is high. ([source](https://betteryou.com/blogs/health-hub/magnesium-vitamin-d-benefits-dosages-types-supplements#:~:text=it%E2%80%99s%20also%20claimed%20that%20magnesium%20supplementation%20increases%20vitamin%20d%20levels%20in%20people%20who%20are%20deficient%20in%20the%20vitamin%2C%20but%20causes%20a%20reduction%20in%20people%20whose%20intake%20is%20high.))
- Vitamin D’s bioavailability depends on magnesium. The enzymes (in the liver and kidneys) that enable vitamin D metabolism—converting it into its active form, calcitriol—can’t work without sufficient amounts of magnesium to draw upon. ([source](<https://betteryou.com/blogs/health-hub/magnesium-vitamin-d-benefits-dosages-types-supplements#:~:text=vitamin%20d%E2%80%99s%20bioavailability%20depends%20on%20magnesium.%20the%20enzymes%20(in%20the%20liver%20and%20kidneys)%20that%20enable%20vitamin%20d%20metabolism%E2%80%94converting%20it%20into%20its%20active%20form%2C%20calcitriol%E2%80%94can%E2%80%99t%20work%20without%20sufficient%20amounts%20of%20magnesium%20to%20draw%20upon.>))
- Magnesium is one of several essential minerals your body needs to stay healthy and function as it should. It benefits you in a whole variety of ways, by: relieving muscle tension and muscle spasms reducing tiredness and fatigue enabling you to wind down before bed, improving the quality of your sleep helping muscle tissue to recover after exercise and sports making you more flexible repairing and replenishing skin, leaving it supple and giving it a natural glow ([source](https://betteryou.com/blogs/health-hub/magnesium-vitamin-d-benefits-dosages-types-supplements#:~:text=Magnesium%20is%20one,a%20natural%20glow))
- If you have a magnesium deficiency (when your body’s magnesium levels are too low), this might cause you to: sleep poorly feel fatigued experience heart palpitations ([source](https://betteryou.com/blogs/health-hub/magnesium-vitamin-d-benefits-dosages-types-supplements#:~:text=If%20you%20have,experience%20heart%20palpitations))
- Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body after calcium, potassium and sodium ([source](https://www.livescience.com/61866-magnesium-vitamin-d.html#:~:text=magnesium%20is%20the%20fourth%20most%20abundant%20mineral%20in%20the%20body%20after%20calcium%2C%20potassium%20and%20sodium))
- A national survey from 2005-2006 found that about half of all Americans didn't consume enough magnesium, the review said ([source](https://www.livescience.com/61866-magnesium-vitamin-d.html#:~:text=a%20national%20survey%20from%202005-2006%20found%20that%20about%20half%20of%20all%20americans%20didn't%20consume%20enough%20magnesium%2C%20the%20review%20said))
- Magnesium has no long term storage in the body (not in fat) like Vitamin D does ([source](<https://vitamindwiki.com/Overview+Magnesium+and+vitamin+D#:~:text=magnesium%20has%20no%20long%20term%20storage%20in%20the%20body%20(not%20in%20fat)%20like%20vitamin%20d%20does>))
- You need to be sure to get Magnesium Threonate and not other forms of magnesium such as magnesium citrate because they have different purposes and do not cross the blood-brain barrier. ([source](https://brainflow.co/index.php/2021/08/14/dr-andrew-hubermans-sleep-cocktail/#:~:text=you%20need%20to%20be%20sure%20to%20get%20magnesium%20threonate%20and%20not%20other%20forms%20of%20magnesium%20such%20as%20magnesium%20citrate%20because%20they%20have%20different%20purposes%20and%20do%20not%20cross%20the%20blood-brain%20barrier.))
- A recent study also uncovered that magesium threonate can increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a protein that stimulates the formation of new brain cells. ([source](<https://brainflow.co/index.php/2021/08/14/dr-andrew-hubermans-sleep-cocktail/#:~:text=a%20recent%20study%20also%20uncovered%20that%20magesium%20threonate%20can%20increase%20brain-derived%20neurotrophic%20factor%20(bdnf)%2C%20which%20is%20a%20protein%20that%20stimulates%20the%20formation%20of%20new%20brain%20cells.>))
- “145mg Magnesium Threonate or 200mg Magnesium Bisglycinate is great as a starting place. I would only take the minimum needed for great sleep. On the bottle it often lists two amounts: elemental magnesium and “magnesium”. The lower amount is the one to pay attention to.” (source: Huberman)
- Huberman recommends taking 300-400mg 30 minutes before bed. It can be a bit confusing when dosing Magnesium Threonate. For example, a supplement may say 2,000mg per serving, but if you look on the back it will say “144mg providing elemental magnesium”. This is the dosage you’re looking for, so 300mg would be two capsules. ([source](https://brainflow.co/index.php/2021/08/14/dr-andrew-hubermans-sleep-cocktail/#:~:text=Huberman%20recommends,two%20capsules.))
- Mg Bisglycinate is a solid substitute for Threonate. ([source](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1428824455913082880#:~:text=mg%20bisglycinate%20is%20a%20solid%20substitute%20for%20threonate.))
