# Water Fluoridation

**tl;dr:** Might be helpful at small levels, but topical fluoride (toothpaste) might give us enough. Controversial. Might be best to avoid giving to children (not necessary for tooth decay, may result in drop in IQ 3-5 points)

## Notes

- WHO and US support optimal levels
- Some like EU don’t necessarily find it beneficial yet
  - Modern toothpaste might have enough fluoride for what we need to prevent tooth decay
- Opponents say not enough data, it’s mass medication, stripping liberties
- Seems like in US, might not be optimal to drink filtered water
- Just the right amount can significantly improve dental health in the population.

- It's been pretty thoroughly vetted by the scientific and health communities. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ojlma/can_someone_clarify_water_fluoridation_for_me/#:~:text=it's%20been%20pretty%20thoroughly%20vetted%20by%20the%20scientific%20and%20health%20communities.))
