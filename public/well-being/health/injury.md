# Injury

## Notes

- [Huberman's protocol for injury treatment](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0hZnn7rEmWTxLaB4l5xWXg?context=spotify%3Auser%3A1242916202%3Acollection%3Ayour-episodes&dl_branch=1&si=rxE49r4iQ2CEXTo3dlSP7A)
  - Ice is a placebo, though it temporarily helps
  - Heat is beneficial - improves viscosity of the tissues, to get them out of the injury area
  - At least 8 hours of sleep
  - At least 10 minutes walking per day
  - Keep moving the area of injury
  - Heating neurons after they've been cooled makes them "hyperactive", can result in more painfulness
