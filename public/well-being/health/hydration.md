# Hydration

## Notes

- Don't chug, if you chug your body flushes it out faster and doesn't use it properly. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/m0fht9/how_to_age_better/#:~:text=Don't%20chug%2C%20if%20you%20chug%20your%20body%20flushes%20it%20out%20faster%20and%20doesn't%20use%20it%20properly.))
- **Unsubstantiated:** Don't drink a ton before eating, you will dilute stomach acids. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/m0fht9/how_to_age_better/#:~:text=Don't%20drink%20a%20ton%20before%20eating%2C%20you%20will%20dilute%20stomach%20acids.))
- **Unsubstantiated:** Drink more room temperature/hot water than cold. Save cold for the summer. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/m0fht9/how_to_age_better/#:~:text=Drink%20more%20room%20temperature%2Fhot%20water%20than%20cold.%20Save%20cold%20for%20the%20summer.))
