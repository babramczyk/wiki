## Drinking Water Before Bed

**Rough consensus**: Stop drinking an hour or two before bed, don't chug but rather drink a moderate amount

Still probably could do more research here. Might be better to drink even before bed, if you don't have trouble waking up in the night to pee. But that could be worse for sleep quality too... 🤷🏼‍♂️

- A consensus that drinking water and staying hydrated throughout the _day_ is best
  - Lessens the need for water at night, which can wake you up to pee in the middle of the night
- If you’re the type of sleeper who is always tossing and turning because you’re either freezing or overheating, having a glass of water before bed may help ([source](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/drinking-water-before-bed/#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99re%20the%20type%20of%20sleeper%20who%20is%20always%20tossing%20and%20turning%20because%20you%E2%80%99re%20either%20freezing%20or%20overheating%2C%20having%20a%20glass%20of%20water%20before%20bed%20may%20help))
- Consensus: If you were dehydrated during the day, it's pretty much always better to drink enough water at night -- even if that results in you having to wake up to pee

## Drinking Hot / Warm Water

**tl;dr:** May help keeping warm. No convincing research really for other benefits. "Cool" water best for rehydration.

> NOTE: There are some sites that seem to suggest hot water before bed benefits you in things like metabolism and digestion. But these all end up being unsubstantiated once you dig in deeper.

- Most health benefits of hot water are based on anecdotal reports, as there’s little scientific research in this area. That said, many people feel benefits from this remedy, especially first thing in the morning or right before bed.

- May relieve nasal congestion ([source](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-drinking-hot-water#:~:text=may%20relieve%20nasal%20congestion))
- When drinking hot beverages, research recommends an optimal temperature of between 130 and 160°F (54 and 71°C). ([source](<https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-drinking-hot-water#:~:text=when%20drinking%20hot%20beverages%2C%20researchtrusted%20source%20recommends%20an%20optimal%20temperature%20of%20between%20130%20and%20160%C2%B0f%20(54%20and%2071%C2%B0c).>))
- Although some evidence shows that cool water is best for rehydration, drinking water at any temperature will help keep you hydrated ([source](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-drinking-hot-water#:~:text=although%20some%20evidencetrusted%20source%20shows%20that%20cool%20water%20is%20best%20for%20rehydration%2C%20drinking%20water%20at%20any%20temperature%20will%20help%20keep%20you%20hydrated))
- Researchers found that drinking the hot water quickly helped the subjects put less work into maintaining their body temperature ([source](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-drinking-hot-water#:~:text=researchers%20found%20that%20drinking%20the%20hot%20water%20quickly%20helped%20the%20subjects%20put%20less%20work%20into%20maintaining%20their%20body%20temperature))
- Taking a warm bath helps your circulatory organs — your arteries and veins — expand and carry blood more effectively throughout your body. Drinking hot water may have a similar effect. However, there’s little research that this is effective. ([source](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-drinking-hot-water#:~:text=Taking%20a%20warm,this%20is%20effective.))
- Drinking warm water before bed is a great way to wind down after a busy day. Knowing about the health benefits will have you sleeping soundly. ([source](www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-drinking-hot-water#:~:text=drinking%20warm%20water%20before%20bed%20is%20a%20great%20way%20to%20wind%20down%20after%20a%20busy%20day.%20knowing%20about%20the%20health%20benefits%20will%20have%20you%20sleeping%20soundly.))
- Apparently, your body gets the water to its internal temp before it does anything with it. Saw one comment saying "within 5 minutes". If true, this would pretty much debunk the claims that it can help with things like e.g. digestion
- Some claim that water far from internal body temp is marginally better for metabolism, because your body has to spend more energy to get it to the body's internal temp

## Notes

- Don't chug, if you chug your body flushes it out faster and doesn't use it properly. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/m0fht9/how_to_age_better/#:~:text=Don't%20chug%2C%20if%20you%20chug%20your%20body%20flushes%20it%20out%20faster%20and%20doesn't%20use%20it%20properly.))
- **Unsubstantiated:** Don't drink a ton before eating, you will dilute stomach acids. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/m0fht9/how_to_age_better/#:~:text=Don't%20drink%20a%20ton%20before%20eating%2C%20you%20will%20dilute%20stomach%20acids.))
- **Unsubstantiated:** Drink more room temperature/hot water than cold. Save cold for the summer. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/m0fht9/how_to_age_better/#:~:text=Drink%20more%20room%20temperature%2Fhot%20water%20than%20cold.%20Save%20cold%20for%20the%20summer.))

- May aid digestion ([source](https://www.healthline.com/health/benefits-of-drinking-hot-water#:~:text=may%20aid%20digestion))
- Research from 2019 has shown that drinking water can improve central nervous system activity, as well as mood. This research showed that drinking water boosted participants’ brain activity during demanding activities and also reduced their self-reported anxiety.
