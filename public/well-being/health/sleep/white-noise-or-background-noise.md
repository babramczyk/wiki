# White Noise or Background Noise

Using white noise (but actually, just any background noise, like ocean sounds, rain sounds, pink noise, etc.), and its effect on sleep.

## Notes

- He is also concerned about the potential ill-effects of not allowing the auditory system to switch off overnight, although this also has not yet been tested. “Whenever we’re exposed to sounds and noise, the inner ear is translating that into nerve signals that are then interpreted by the brain,” he said. “It is an active process, which generates metabolites, some of which have been shown to be harmful to the inner ear. You probably want to have a period where the auditory system can wind down, regenerate and prepare for the next wake period.” ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/18/white-noise-as-sleep-aid-may-do-more-harm-than-good-say-scientists#:~:text=He%20is,period.%E2%80%9D))
- I think the better [forms of] continuous white noise mask highly intermittent background noise, which is why it is recommended for nightshift workers who often need to sleep during the day in a ‘noisy’ environment. There I can see a benefit, but not when sleeping in a relatively quiet environment.

- Pink noise has potential as a sleep aid. In a small 2012 study in the Journal of Theoretical Biology, researchers found that steady pink noise reduces brain waves, which increases stable sleep.

- A 2017 study in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience also found a positive link between pink noise and deep sleep. Deep sleep supports memory and helps you feel refreshed in the morning.

- There isn’t a lot of scientific research on pink noise, though. There’s more evidence on the benefits of white noise for sleep. ([source](https://www.healthline.com/health/pink-noise-sleep#:~:text=there%20isn%E2%80%99t%20a%20lot%20of%20scientific%20research%20on%20pink%20noise%2C%20though.%20there%E2%80%99s%20more%20evidence%20on%20the%20benefits%20of%20white%20noise%20for%20sleep.))

- That means over time your brain will associate the process of going to sleep with having the white noise machine on.

- Matthew Walker seems largely unconcerned about it, but admits studies aren't too useful right now
- Could get used to it, but I'm not really too concerned about that. It's kind of nonnegotiable if you're in a loud environment and can't really do earplugs
