## Setting the clock

Much of our biological system and clock is anchored by the neurons in our eyes receiving light for sunrise and sunset. This biological clock anchors a lot for our mind and our body.

- Getting this light tells the body when to be awake and when to sleep
- Getting sunlight-like light early will, after 2-3 days, result in you being more wakeful earlier
  - Also has effects on other things, like mood, health, etc.

### Notes

- Based around a "surge" of cortisol light/sunlight induces
  - Cortisol _is_ the stress-inducing hormone, but this is good in the morning
  - The earlier you can get this surge, the better. It starts to wake up the body, making it more alert
- The light needs to be similar to sunrise/sunset for it to be properly effective
  - Blue light in the morning is actually good, since it's like the sun
    - Still, don't look at painful blue light ever (i.e. if you feel the need to blink)
  - The angle of the sun at sunrise/sunset has an effect
- Once you start getting sunrise-like light, the body sets a "clock" for 12-14 hours, after which it starts releasing Melatonin to induce sleep
- Low or very dim lights will not affect this clock very much (e.g. candles, lights on the floor)
  - Example of a scientist "turning his home into a cave" at night to help with this
- "Get outside" to get this light and exercise early in the day
  - The light taken in through a window is ~50x less than if you were outside
- The amount of time you should go outside to get this light depends on where you live (because of the sun exposure)
  - But basically get outside at sunrise and sunset
  - "2-10 minutes" should be enough for most people/places
- The process is subconcious -- so it even works for blind people, since the light still gets into their eyes
  - Fun fact: The holes in the skull for eyes developed not for vision, but initially for this intake of light. Snakes, for examples, have holes in their skull purely for this purpose
- Studies have shown that getting blue light between 11pm-4am suppresses dopamine output, which can effect mood
  - Fine if it just happens one time/rarely, but not good as a habit
- Turning on (overhead) lights 45-60 minutes before you wake up can be beneficial for setting your clock
- If you're waking up groggy from naps, you're not getting enough sleep at night
- Can also use "non-sleep deep rest"
  - Forms of relaxation for the mind that don't necessarily put the mind to sleep
    - Yoga Nidra
    - Meditation
    - Hypnosis
    - 20min sleep (_almost_ not quite, but almost because you rarely drop into deep sleep)
  - These can help train the mind better, so that it can relax when it's time to sleep at night
- After a few days of sleeping/waking at the same times, body will secrete hormones around those times to encourage sleeping/waking

## Defeating jet lag

To adjust for jet lag, you need to tell you body to adjust its clock in the 2-3 days before you travel.

- Based around your temperature minimum, which happens 2.5hrs before you wake up
- Can **eat**, **view light**, and **exercise** around this time to advance or delay your clock
  - Doing these in 4-5 hrs **after** your temp minimum will **advance clock backwards**, making you want to go to bed and wake up **earlier**
  - Doing these in 4-5 hrs **before** your temp minimum will **delay your clock forwards**, making you want to go to bed and wake up **later**
- Using this method can shift your clock 1-3 hrs per night/day you use it
- In order to do this, you need to **track your temp minimum** (time) in wherever you're coming from
- When you land, **eat in the local meal schedule**
- Exercising after landing can help: raises NAD levels (source: anecdotally from Joe Rogan)

## Sleep Paralysis

- Atonia: When the muscle can't move
- Marijuana smokers report higher frequency

## Sleep Schedule

- Some humans predisposed to going to bed and waking up earlier, some later
  - Theory is that this was helpful for ancestor tribes -- people awake can keep watch
- On weekends when schedule shifts, two important things to maintain (source: Huberman)
  - Getting morning light outside
  - Try to maintain sleep schedule
  - Don't go to bed early because you stayed out the night before

## Sleep for the elderly

Notes taken from Why We Sleep book.

**tl;dr:** The elderly need just as much sleep, but are just worse at it. They need help. This has many health, memory implications.

## Notes

- A study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that resistance training in particular that decrease times woken up after initially falling asleep.

- Pills like Ambien and Benadryl have side effects such as sleepwalking, dehydration, and prolonged grogginess and put you at a higher risk of getting a blood clot on a long flight. ([source](https://casper.com/blog/how-to-sleep-on-a-plane/#:~:text=Pills%20like%20Ambien%20and%20Benadryl%20have%20side%20effects%20such%20as%20sleepwalking%2C%20dehydration%2C%20and%20prolonged%20grogginess%20and%20put%20you%20at%20a%20higher%20risk%20of%20getting%20a%20blood%20clot%20on%20a%20long%20flight.))
- If you’re fortunate enough to be able to control the temperature where you live, set your bedroom to drop to 65 degrees at the time you intend to go to sleep. ([source](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Why-We-Sleep#:~:text=If%20you%E2%80%99re%20fortunate%20enough%20to%20be%20able%20to%20control%20the%20temperature%20where%20you%20live%2C%20set%20your%20bedroom%20to%20drop%20to%2065%20degrees%20at%20the%20time%20you%20intend%20to%20go%20to%20sleep.))
- A human that is fasting will sleep less, as the brain is tricked into thinking that food has suddenly become scarce (source: Why We Sleep book)
- Intermittent fasting may help with sleep quality, needing less sleep. See Intermittent Fasting notes for details
- Study showed that people can't tell or accurately assess how much sleep is impairing them, while they are behind on sleep / impaired (source: Why We Sleep book)
- Best to keep sleeping area separate from other areas, like watching TV or working ([source](https://www.fastcompany.com/90567684/the-case-for-taking-a-mid-day-nap-according-to-experts#:~:text=%E2%80%9Cif%20you%20start%20to%20work%2C%20sleep%2C%20and%20watch%20netflix%20in%20bed%2C%20your%20brain%20gets%20confused%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20robbins.%20%E2%80%9Cand%20that%E2%80%99s%20where%20we%20can%20develop%20insomnia.%E2%80%9D))
- Biologically programmed spike in alertness 60 minutes before bed (source: Huberman)
  - Historically, humans needed to gather resources before sleep
  - Passes after 45-60 minutes
  - Don't worry about this -- instead, do mundane tasks in this time (e.g. cleaning)
- Sleep on side or with elevated feet to help with Glymphatic clearance
  - Glymphatic system: The system that clears debris between neurons, especially injured neurons. Very active during sleep. You want this system very active. Repairs connection between neurons.
  - Huberman experiments with sleeping with feet slightly elevated, says it helps him wake up feeling more refreshed, helps him sleep more deeply. Also sleeping on your side helps with this. Has to do with Glymphatic clearance ([source: 43:00](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0hZnn7rEmWTxLaB4l5xWXg?si=8PV-qlW-QpSxyd4N-rdnEA))
