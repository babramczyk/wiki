## Huberman standing / sitting advice

[Podcast source](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4iv5HsKqxWQ0P3gkxQOtE4?si=40598e8461da4b17)

- Sit half the day, stand half the day
- We weren't meant to stand all day, just like we weren't meant to sit all day
- Standing makes you more alert, sitting makes you more calm
- Stand, but don't lean

### Movement (treadmill)

- No cognitive difference between treadmill vs. cycling
- Improvement in attention and cognitive ability (vs seating)
  - But, verbal memory recall scores is worse
  - So, don't do it for talking work. But maybe for analytical work, etc.
- Might reduce anxiety, because of optic flow
  - n.b. _I'm not sure how stationary treadmills induce optic flow, though..?_

## Notes

- Medical researchers have long warned that prolonged sitting is dangerous, associated with a significantly higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and depression, as well as muscle and joint problems. Some have gone on to say that the office chair is worse for your health than smoking and kills more people than HIV. Even working out vigorously before or after work may not compensate for extending sitting.

- Metabolism slows down 90 percent after 30 minutes of sitting ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/02/medical-researchers-have-figured-out-how-much-time-is-okay-to-spend-sitting-each-day/#:~:text=Metabolism%20slows%20down%2090%20percent%20after%2030%20minutes%20of%20sitting))
- The enzymes that move the bad fat from your arteries to your muscles, where it can get burned off, slow down. The muscles in your lower body are turned off. And after two hours, good cholesterol drops 20 percent. Just getting up for five minutes is going to get things going again.
