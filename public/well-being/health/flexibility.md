# Flexibility

## Hamstring Tightness

- Tight hamstrings/glutes can be a source of low back pain
- Important to work on the whole "posterior chain"
- Posterior chain includes hamstrings, calves, and glutes

### "Don't stretch your hamstrings"

A general train of thought where you shouldn't just blindly stretch your hamstrings, because your pelvic tilt might be off (and therefore you should fix that first). Otherwise you could be making it worse.

### Stretching program

- Ideally 2-3x per day
- Got this from Bryan D.

**Glutes**

3-4x each leg, 25-30s holds

**Hamstrings**

3-4x each side with strap, 25-30s holds

**Calves**

3-4x each leg, 25-30s holds

**Other stuff**

- Foam roll if available
  - Glutes, hamstrings, and calves (1-2 mins per muscle group)
- Light ab/core work 2-3x a week

## PNF Stretching

- Supposed to be really good for getting you flexible
- Works by loosening muscle through contraction, so that it can stretch further
- From Bryan: "Works best when you have a partner"
- Harder alone, but still doable (e.g. with a strap)

## Notes

- Key to getting more flexible is consistency
  - Ideally 3-4 times per day
- "A solid stretching session is like 30s holds 3-4 times each side" (Bryan)
- Strengthening the core/abs can help take the load of the lower back
