# Flexibility

### Hamstring Tightness

- Tight hamstrings/glutes can be a source of low back pain
- Important to work on the whole "posterior chain"
- Posterior chain includes hamstrings, calves, and glutes

#### Stretching program

- Ideally 2-3x per day
- Got this from Bryan D.

**Glutes**

3-4x each leg, 25-30s holds

**Hamstrings**

3-4x each side with strap, 25-30s holds

**Calves**

3-4x each leg, 25-30s holds

**Other stuff**

- Foam roll if available
  - Glutes, hamstrings, and calves (1-2 mins per muscle group)
- Light ab/core work 2-3x a week

### PNF Stretching

- Supposed to be really good for getting you flexible
- Works by loosening muscle through contraction, so that it can stretch further
- From Bryan: "Works best when you have a partner"
- Harder alone, but still doable (e.g. with a strap)

## Notes

- Key to getting more flexible is consistency
  - Ideally 3-4 times per day
- "A solid stretching session is like 30s holds 3-4 times each side" (Bryan)
- Strengthening the core/abs can help take the load of the lower back
