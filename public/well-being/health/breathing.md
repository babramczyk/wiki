# Breathing

## Notes

- Nasal breathing releases nitric oxide into the airways and carries it into the lungs. Sunlight liberates nitrite from your skin and increases circulating levels of nitric oxide. When combined, you get better blood flow and oxygenation.

- But how do we expand lung capacity? Nestor provides a few different ways. Light to moderate exercise Lung expanding breathwork Long and complete exhales ([source](https://www.thebreathingdiabetic.com/blog/tag/Andrew+Huberman#:~:text=But%20how,complete%20exhales))
- Long exhales also increase lung capacity by allowing “more air to get in” on the next breath. But, they have the added longevity benefit of activating the “relaxation response.”
- To live longer, we should breathe through our noses all the time, increase our lung capacity, and practice extended exhales.
