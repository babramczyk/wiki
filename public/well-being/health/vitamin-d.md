# Vitamin D

## Notes

- Salmon, tuna, sardines, sun-dried mushrooms, eggs, fortified milk and orange juice high in Vitamin D
- Vegans are at higher risk for deficiency
- D3 if not vegan, D2 if vegan (for supplementation)
- Even if you don't have any winter problems, you still don't get enough vitamin D unless you already eat intentionally fortified food, and a lot of it!

- Take them year round unless you work in the sun or something ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/k1wrjn/psa_take_vitamin_d_supplements_you_need_them_and/#:~:text=take%20them%20year%20round%20unless%20you%20work%20in%20the%20sun%20or%20something))
- You do not have to take them daily. They build up in your system over a series of months, unlike vitamin C or whatever, so you can overdose over time easier but also you can slack a little on your dosage.

- In general, 1k IU per day will be safe and even up to 4k will be fine. Just remember you don't need to take every day like other supplements.

- They're the most effective if you eat them with something oily/fatty. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/k1wrjn/psa_take_vitamin_d_supplements_you_need_them_and/#:~:text=they're%20the%20most%20effective%20if%20you%20eat%20them%20with%20something%20oily%2Ffatty.))
- Also Vit D is fat soluble, you'll need to take it in a capsule ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/k1wrjn/psa_take_vitamin_d_supplements_you_need_them_and/#:~:text=also%20vit%20d%20is%20fat%20soluble%2C%20you'll%20need%20to%20take%20it%20in%20a%20capsule))
- Potentially unsafe amounts of vitamin D — that is, more than 4,000 international units (IU) per day, according to a research letter ([source](<https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks#:~:text=potentially%20unsafe%20amounts%20of%20vitamin%20d%20%E2%80%94%20that%20is%2C%20more%20than%204%2C000%20international%20units%20(iu)%20per%20day%2C%20according%20to%20a%20research%20letter>))
- Those who took vitamin D supplements for at least two years had a 25% lower chance of dying from their cancer compared with those who received a placebo.

- If you live in the northern states (latitudes north of 37°), you are at higher risk for a vitamin D deficiency because your skin may not be able to produce any vitamin D from sun exposure during the winter months. ([source](<https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks#:~:text=if%20you%20live%20in%20the%20northern%20states%20(latitudes%20north%20of%2037%C2%B0)%2C%20you%20are%20at%20higher%20risk%20for%20a%20vitamin%20d%20deficiency%20because%20your%20skin%20may%20not%20be%20able%20to%20produce%20any%20vitamin%20d%20from%20sun%20exposure%20during%20the%20winter%20months.>))
- Your skin's ability to produce vitamin D drops with age. If you're over age 65, you generate only one-fourth as much vitamin D as you did in your 20s. ([source](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks#:~:text=your%20skin's%20ability%20to%20produce%20vitamin%20d%20drops%20with%20age.%20if%20you're%20over%20age%2065%2C%20you%20generate%20only%20one-fourth%20as%20much%20vitamin%20d%20as%20you%20did%20in%20your%2020s.))
- People with darker skin typically have lower levels of vitamin D than lighter-skinned individuals. African Americans have, on average, about half as much vitamin D in their blood compared with white Americans.

- If you have a body mass index above 30, you may have low blood levels of vitamin D. ([source](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks#:~:text=if%20you%20have%20a%20body%20mass%20index%20above%2030%2C%20you%20may%20have%20low%20blood%20levels%20of%20vitamin%20d.))
- Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. ([source](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks#:~:text=very%20few%20foods%20naturally%20contain%20vitamin%20d.))
- If you're taking a vitamin D supplement, you probably don't need more than 600 to 800 IU per day, which is adequate for most people. ([source](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks#:~:text=if%20you're%20taking%20a%20vitamin%20d%20supplement%2C%20you%20probably%20don't%20need%20more%20than%20600%20to%20800%20iu%20per%20day%2C%20which%20is%20adequate%20for%20most%20people.))
- Yet, a recent survey found that 40% of Americans are deficient in vitamin D, especially African Americans, people who smoke, those who get little sun exposure or regularly use sunscreen, adults over age 65, and those with obesity or diabetes ([source](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-vitamin-d-supplements#:~:text=yet%2C%20a%20recent%20survey%20found%20that%2040%25%20of%20americans%20are%20deficient%20in%20vitamin%20d%2C%20especially%20african%20americans%2C%20people%20who%20smoke%2C%20those%20who%20get%20little%20sun%20exposure%20or%20regularly%20use%20sunscreen%2C%20adults%20over%20age%2065%2C%20and%20those%20with%20obesity%20or%20diabetes))
- A simple test is to look at your shadow. If its the same height or shorter than you, you’re getting enough sun to make vitamin D. If its longer than you, you’re probably not. In most places in the US in the winter, you can probably guess what you’re going to see.

- Adults need 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D each day (800 IU if you’re over age 70), which can be sourced through sunlight, diet, or supplements. ([source](<https://www.everydayhealth.com/vitamin-d/you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-everything-know/#:~:text=adults%20need%20600%20international%20units%20(iu)%20of%20vitamin%20d%20each%20day%20(800%20iu%20if%20you%E2%80%99re%20over%20age%2070)%2C%20which%20can%20be%20sourced%20through%20sunlight%2C%20diet%2C%20or%20supplements.>))
- Might help in preventing things like heart disease, cancer, flu, multiple sclerosis, but research still isn't the best in this area
- Common symptoms of deficiency include feeling tired and achy, though often there are no symptoms at all. ([source](https://www.everydayhealth.com/vitamin-d/you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-everything-know/#:~:text=common%20symptoms%20of%20deficiency%20include%20feeling%20tired%20and%20achy%2C%20though%20often%20there%20are%20no%20symptoms%20at%20all.))
- The supplements tested in the aforementioned research had between 9 and 146 percent of the expected dose. ([source](https://www.everydayhealth.com/vitamin-d/you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-everything-know/#:~:text=the%20supplements%20tested%20in%20the%20aforementioned%20research%20had%20between%209%20and%20146%20percent%20of%20the%20expected%20dose.))
- The researchers found supplements from a USP-verified bottle were the most accurate and least variable, so when you’re looking for a supplement, be on the lookout for the USP mark. ([source](https://www.everydayhealth.com/vitamin-d/you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-everything-know/#:~:text=the%20researchers%20found%20supplements%20from%20a%20usp-verified%20bottle%20were%20the%20most%20accurate%20and%20least%20variable%2C%20so%20when%20you%E2%80%99re%20looking%20for%20a%20supplement%2C%20be%20on%20the%20lookout%20for%20the%20usp%20mark.))
- A lot of controversy still on how much to supplement
- Our bodies can only produce natural vitamin D when the sun is above a 45 degree angle. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/kojv0l/germany_light_and_depression/#:~:text=our%20bodies%20can%20only%20produce%20natural%20vitamin%20d%20when%20the%20sun%20is%20above%20a%2045%20degree%20angle.))
- Vitamin K2 is only found in certain animal-derived foods and fermented foods like natto, kimchi, and sauerkraut. ([source](https://www.wellnessverge.com/athletic-greens-review#:~:text=vitamin%20k2%20is%20only%20found%20in%20certain%20animal-derived%20foods%20and%20fermented%20foods%20like%20natto%2C%20kimchi%2C%20and%20sauerkraut.))
- Vitamins D3 and K2 that you can take in addition to this daily product. Why? These two nutrients work together to help support your skeletal strength and bone health, muscle function, and normal immune response. ([source](https://www.wellnessverge.com/athletic-greens-review#:~:text=vitamins%20D3,immune%20response.))
- Vitamin D is stored in your fat and liver and is released back into your body when you are low. So if you have a decent supply by the end of summer, it should last you until spring again.
