# Anxiety

## Notes

- Optic flow (self-generated): Getting objects moving past you / your eyes (i.e. moving) help lower activity of amygdala, and therefore **reduce anxiety** (source: Huberman)
- How and when we breathe can have effects here. See Breath book by James Nestor
- Raise stress threshold by highly activating body and/or stimulating adrenaline release, but then calming mind
  - i.e. running at max capacity (or close to it), dilate gaze to relax mind
    - To dilate gaze: not moving head and eyes around
      - Going from tunnel vision to broader, panoramic vision, seeing more of environment all at once
