# Flossing

## Do you need to floss?

**tl;dr:** The studies on this suck, but most experts agree based on common sense and the low effort it takes that it probably just makes sense to to it

- The evidence for flossing’s benefits is inconsistent in part because studies haven’t followed people long enough to detect potential improvements ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/beauty-personal-care/should-you-bother-to-floss-your-teeth/#:~:text=the%20evidence%20for%20flossing%E2%80%99s%20benefits%20is%20inconsistent%20in%20part%20because%20studies%20haven%E2%80%99t%20followed%20people%20long%20enough%20to%20detect%20potential%20improvements))
- The majority of available studies fail to demonstrate that flossing is generally effective in plaque removal and in reducing gingival inflammation ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/beauty-personal-care/should-you-bother-to-floss-your-teeth/#:~:text=the%20majority%20of%20available%20studies%20fail%20to%20demonstrate%20that%20flossing%20is%20generally%20effective%20in%20plaque%20removal%20and%20in%20reducing%20gingival%20inflammation))
- The mixed findings may also be related to how well or poorly people use dental floss. In a 2010 review of six studies, researchers at the University of Washington School of Dentistry found that when youngsters 4 to 13 had their teeth professionally flossed five days per week for 1.7 years, they saw a 40 percent drop in their cavity risk. But adolescents who flossed on their own saw no such benefit.

- Flossing can help dislodge small pieces of food, along with rinsing vigorously with water after eating ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/beauty-personal-care/should-you-bother-to-floss-your-teeth/#:~:text=flossing%20can%20help%20dislodge%20small%20pieces%20of%20food%2C%20along%20with%20rinsing%20vigorously%20with%20water%20after%20eating))
- Flossing with a water-jet device may be especially helpful. “Water flossing has been shown to be more effective in removing plaque," Friedman says, "and is recommended by periodontists ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/beauty-personal-care/should-you-bother-to-floss-your-teeth/#:~:text=flossing%20with%20a%20water-jet%20device%20may%20be%20especially%20helpful.%20%E2%80%9Cwater%20flossing%20has%20been%20shown%20to%20be%20more%20effective%20in%20removing%20plaque%2C%22%20friedman%20says%2C%20%22and%20is%20recommended%20by%20periodontists))
- Even sceptics of flossing say cleaning between your teeth is good for you. A Dutch periodontist who has conducted flossing studies says he uses a toothpick.

- If you have big gaps between your teeth, you don't need to worry about it ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/266x2q/why_are_americans_so_obsessed_with_flossing/#:~:text=if%20you%20have%20big%20gaps%20between%20your%20teeth%2C%20you%20don't%20need%20to%20worry%20about%20it))

## Water flossers vs traditional string floss

**tl;dr:** There's some resistance to water flossers, with the thinking they can't get as much plaque off as a string. Limited studies show water flossers actually better. Difference is up in the air; go with what you prefer

- Both traditional dental floss and water flossers are considered to be extremely effective at cleaning plaque and food out from between teeth and gums, and preventing gum disease such as gingivitis. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/4wafoj/water_flossers_vs_string_floss/#:~:text=both%20traditional%20dental%20floss%20and%20water%20flossers%20are%20considered%20to%20be%20extremely%20effective%20at%20cleaning%20plaque%20and%20food%20out%20from%20between%20teeth%20and%20gums%2C%20and%20preventing%20gum%20disease%20such%20as%20gingivitis.))
- Water flossers are 29% more effective at removing dental plaque than regular floss [Study] ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/4wafoj/water_flossers_vs_string_floss/#:~:text=water%20flossers%20are%2029%25%20more%20effective%20at%20removing%20dental%20plaque%20than%20regular%20floss%20%5Bstudy%5D))
- They are 51% more effective at reducing gingivitis [Study] ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/4wafoj/water_flossers_vs_string_floss/#:~:text=they%20are%2051%25%20more%20effective%20at%20reducing%20gingivitis%20%5Bstudy%5D))
- Experts don't seem to have come to a unanimous decision on the issue of waterpik vs flossing. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/4wafoj/water_flossers_vs_string_floss/#:~:text=experts%20don't%20seem%20to%20have%20come%20to%20a%20unanimous%20decision%20on%20the%20issue%20of%20waterpik%20vs%20flossing.))
- But most experts simply care about the dental health of their patients. What I mean by this is that the difference between these 2 methods is so minimal that as long as their patients are doing something and they are able to consistently do it, the dentists are happy. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/4wafoj/water_flossers_vs_string_floss/#:~:text=but%20most%20experts%20simply%20care%20about%20the%20dental%20health%20of%20their%20patients.%20what%20i%20mean%20by%20this%20is%20that%20the%20difference%20between%20these%202%20methods%20is%20so%20minimal%20that%20as%20long%20as%20their%20patients%20are%20doing%20something%20and%20they%20are%20able%20to%20consistently%20do%20it%2C%20the%20dentists%20are%20happy.))
- To put it simply: use whichever method you prefer. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/4wafoj/water_flossers_vs_string_floss/#:~:text=to%20put%20it%20simply%3A%20use%20whichever%20method%20you%20prefer.))
- Many dentists seem resistant -- say it can't get the deeply attached plaque
  - But studies disagree with them

## Flosses (to buy)

- All flosses clean effectively ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/toothbrushes/buying-guide/index.htm#:~:text=All%20flosses%20clean%20effectively))
- Apparently you can get different flosses that are better suited for your teeth

## Notes

- **Floss before brushing**
- Seems like flossing at night is marginally better
- Dentists: 1 time per day
- Helps prevent gingivitis
  - Gingivitis linked to loss of bone that holds teeth in place
  - Gingivitis linked to Alzheimer’s
  - “Gingivitis is inflammation of the gums, caused by bacteria taking hold between the teeth at the gum line, forming a tough, sticky “plaque.””
- Technique:
  - Make “c” shape around the tooth
  - Go up and down on either side 5 times
- Try to do it every night with normal floss
  - If that isn’t working out, **try water flossers or interdental brushes**
- Flossing isn't just to remove plaque or whatever by scraping it away... it's actually also is to disrupt bacteria colonies that "settle" in your mouth, undisturbed, kind of like an anthill or something. And by flossing you're destroying all their colonies and stomping on all the anthills... you're not just "removing gunk".
