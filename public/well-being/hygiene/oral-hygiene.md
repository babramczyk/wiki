# Oral Hygiene

## Brushing

- Why?
  - Remove plaque
    - Can lead to gingivitis
  - Prevent tooth decay
    - Can lead to cavitities
      - Holes in the tooth that can lead to tooth loss
  - Bacteria from your mouth can make its way into your bloodstream and increase you chance of a heart attack or stroke.
  - Serious gum disease can affect body’s ability to control blood glucose, leading to **diabetes**
  - White teeth
- Dentists: 2 times per day for **2 minutes**
  - Helps remove more plaque
    - Study: 45 seconds to 2 minutes resulted in 26% less plaque
    - Study: 1 minute removed **27% of plaque**, 2 minutes remove **41% of plaque**
- Some people on Reddit do it weekly, or “whenever they feel dirty”
- Brush tongue a few times to **remove bad breath**
- If brushing after a meal and it had citrus/acid (like coffee) **wait before brushing**
  - Some say wait **an hour**, others say **15-20 minutes**
  - Brushing after citrus can remove enamel
  - Can rinse mouth before brushing teeth, to help with this
  - If you can’t wait an hour, then try brushing before eating/drinking
  - If you can’t wait an hour, rinse mouth and do gum/mints
- Use a light touch while brushing
  - If bristles of brush are flattened, that means you’re brushing too hard
  - Don’t scrub; **massage** the teeth
- Toothbrush
  - Bristles need to be soft (in order to get in crannies well)
- **How To**
  - Up-and-down in little circular motions
  - Don’t go side to side
  - A few brushes per area, then **sweep away from gums** to sweep away plaque you loosened up
  - For front teeth, turn toothbrush vertically and do up-and-down circular motions
  - Brush tongue from back to front to remove bacteria from tongue
- **Don’t rinse after brushing**
  - Lowers the concentration of fluoride
  - Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel
  - Fluoride reduces the amount of acid that bacteria on teeth produce
  - Most places say don’t even do mouthwash after rinsing
    - Some do say that it can be an alternative to water
- Make sure to get the gum line
  - AKA where the tooth meets the gum
  - Use 45-degree angle to do so
- Some experts say brushing before you eat breakfast is vastly more beneficial for your tooth enamel and overall oral health. ([source](https://www.healthline.com/health/should-you-brush-your-teeth-before-or-after-breakfast#:~:text=Some%20experts%20say%20brushing%20before%20you%20eat%20breakfast%20is%20vastly%20more%20beneficial%20for%20your%20tooth%20enamel%20and%20overall%20oral%20health.))
- Eating too soon after brushing your teeth can weaken your tooth’s enamel and cause more problems down the line.

  - As a general rule, wait 30 minutes after brushing teeth to eat
  - Eating after brushing washes away fluoride
- Brushing your teeth before you have coffee removes plaque buildup and makes it more difficult for stains to adhere, said Christina Meiners, a dentist at the nonprofit CommuniCare Health Centers in San Antonio. “If you keep it nice and clean, then there’s less for [coffee] to grab onto your teeth or adhere to,” Meiners said.

- Can rinse w/ water after coffee to neutralize the acidity level
- Electric toothbrushes are 30-40% more effective than normal ones (source: estimation from my dentist)
- It's OK to occasionally skip a brushing, since it takes about 24 hours for plaque and bacteria to form on your teeth. ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/toothbrushes/buying-guide/index.htm#:~:text=It's%20OK%20to%20occasionally%20skip%20a%20brushing%2C%20since%20it%20takes%20about%2024%20hours%20for%20plaque%20and%20bacteria%20to%20form%20on%20your%20teeth.))

## Toothbrush

- Reviews on Oral B vs Sonicare are pretty divided
- You don’t necessarily need to switch from a manual toothbrush to an electric toothbrush if your dentist says you’re doing a fine job with your current setup. But an electric brush can help some people do a better job removing plaque ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/toothbrushes/buying-guide/index.htm#:~:text=You%20don%E2%80%99t%20necessarily%20need%20to%20switch%20from%20a%20manual%20toothbrush%20to%20an%20electric%20toothbrush%20if%20your%20dentist%20says%20you%E2%80%99re%20doing%20a%20fine%20job%20with%20your%20current%20setup.%20But%20an%20electric%20brush%20can%20help%20some%20people%20do%20a%20better%20job%20removing%20plaque))
- There is some research that indicates powered brushes might do a slightly better job of cleaning away plaque and warding off gingivitis and gum disease ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/toothbrushes/buying-guide/index.htm#:~:text=there%20is%20some%20research%20that%20indicates%20powered%20brushes%20might%20do%20a%20slightly%20better%20job%20of%20cleaning%20away%20plaque%20and%20warding%20off%20gingivitis%20and%20gum%20disease))
- Replace your brush or brush head every three or four months, whenever your bristles start to splay ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/toothbrushes/buying-guide/index.htm#:~:text=Replace%20your%20brush%20or%20brush%20head%20every%20three%20or%20four%20months%2C%20whenever%20your%20bristles%20start%20to%20splay))
- One key thing to look for when purchasing any brush, manual or electric, is the American Dental Association (ADA) seal of acceptance ([source](<https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/toothbrushes/buying-guide/index.htm#:~:text=One%20key%20thing%20to%20look%20for%20when%20purchasing%20any%20brush%2C%20manual%20or%20electric%2C%20is%20the%20American%20Dental%20Association%20(ADA)%20seal%20of%20acceptance>))
- The cheapest (electric) models didn't remove plaque as well as moderate-to-expensive models, but amongst the better performing brushes, spending more didn't necessarily improve cleaning performance ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/toothbrushes/buying-guide/index.htm#:~:text=The%20cheapest%20models%20didn't%20remove%20plaque%20as%20well%20as%20moderate-to-expensive%20models%2C%20but%20amongst%20the%20better%20performing%20brushes%2C%20spending%20more%20didn't%20necessarily%20improve%20cleaning%20performance))
- Choose a brush with soft bristles, which are gentler on the gums and may clean better because they're more flexible ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/toothbrushes/buying-guide/index.htm#:~:text=Choose%20a%20brush%20with%20soft%20bristles%2C%20which%20are%20gentler%20on%20the%20gums%20and%20may%20clean%20better%20because%20they're%20more%20flexible))
- How to floss: Break off about 18 inches of floss and wind most of it around a finger; wind the rest around the same finger on your other hand. Use a careful sawing motion to slide the floss between your teeth down or up to the gum line; then gently move the thread slightly under the gums. Next, curve it into a "C" shape against the side of one tooth and sweep it up and down. Repeat for both sides of each tooth, unwinding clean floss from the first hand. ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/toothbrushes/buying-guide/index.htm#:~:text=How%20to%20floss,the%20first%20hand.))
- Chris Strandburg, DDS, dentist and Waterpik spokesperson, avoids any electric toothbrush that doesn’t have oscillating motion. ([source](https://www.self.com/story/electric-toothbrush-buying-guide#:~:text=Chris%20Strandburg%2C%20DDS%2C%20dentist%20and%20Waterpik%20spokesperson%2C%20avoids%20any%20electric%20toothbrush%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20have%20oscillating%20motion.))
- Some important settings include a self-timer, a pressure sensor, and a range of cleaning modes ([source](https://www.self.com/story/electric-toothbrush-buying-guide#:~:text=Some%20important%20settings%20include%20a%20self-timer%2C%20a%20pressure%20sensor%2C%20and%20a%20range%20of%20cleaning%20modes))
- Electric toothbrushes are more affordable than they used to be, but Morris doesn’t recommend spending less than $50. “The quality will be poor and it won’t last,” he says. ([source](https://www.self.com/story/electric-toothbrush-buying-guide#:~:text=Electric%20toothbrushes%20are%20more%20affordable%20than%20they%20used%20to%20be%2C%20but%20Morris%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20recommend%20spending%20less%20than%20%2450.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20quality%20will%20be%20poor%20and%20it%20won%E2%80%99t%20last%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20says))

## Toothpaste

- The "whitening" toothpastes don't really whiten the way white strips do. The toothpaste whitening just polishes away surface enamel stains.

## Flossing

- **Floss before brushing**
- Seems like flossing at night is marginally better
- Dentists: 1 time per day
- Helps prevent gingivitis
  - Gingivitis linked to loss of bone that holds teeth in place
  - Gingivitis linked to Alzheimer’s
  - “Gingivitis is inflammation of the gums, caused by bacteria taking hold between the teeth at the gum line, forming a tough, sticky “plaque.””
- **Multiple studies** saw “very little additional removal of plaque” from flossing
  - [https://elemental.medium.com/do-you-actually-need-to-floss-ca33c00bcd21](https://elemental.medium.com/do-you-actually-need-to-floss-ca33c00bcd21)
- **But**, there’s problems with these studies
  - People lie about flossing, so it’s hard to study it
  - Can’t be a control group, as you can’t ethically enforce that someone doesn’t floss
- Most people suck at flossing, so they don’t get the real benefit
- Technique:
  - Make “c” shape around the tooth
  - Go up and down on either side 5 times
- Try to do it every night with normal floss
  - If that isn’t working out, **try water flossers or interdental brushes**
- The evidence for flossing’s benefits is inconsistent in part because studies haven’t followed people long enough to detect potential improvements ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/beauty-personal-care/should-you-bother-to-floss-your-teeth/#:~:text=the%20evidence%20for%20flossing%E2%80%99s%20benefits%20is%20inconsistent%20in%20part%20because%20studies%20haven%E2%80%99t%20followed%20people%20long%20enough%20to%20detect%20potential%20improvements))
- The majority of available studies fail to demonstrate that flossing is generally effective in plaque removal and in reducing gingival inflammation ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/beauty-personal-care/should-you-bother-to-floss-your-teeth/#:~:text=the%20majority%20of%20available%20studies%20fail%20to%20demonstrate%20that%20flossing%20is%20generally%20effective%20in%20plaque%20removal%20and%20in%20reducing%20gingival%20inflammation))
- The mixed findings may also be related to how well or poorly people use dental floss. In a 2010 review of six studies, researchers at the University of Washington School of Dentistry found that when youngsters 4 to 13 had their teeth professionally flossed five days per week for 1.7 years, they saw a 40 percent drop in their cavity risk. But adolescents who flossed on their own saw no such benefit. ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/beauty-personal-care/should-you-bother-to-floss-your-teeth/#:~:text=The%20mixed,such%20benefit.))
- [Should You Bother to Floss Your Teeth? - Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/beauty-personal-care/should-you-bother-to-floss-your-teeth/)
- Flossing can help dislodge small pieces of food, along with rinsing vigorously with water after eating ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/beauty-personal-care/should-you-bother-to-floss-your-teeth/#:~:text=flossing%20can%20help%20dislodge%20small%20pieces%20of%20food%2C%20along%20with%20rinsing%20vigorously%20with%20water%20after%20eating))
- Flossing with a water-jet device may be especially helpful. “Water flossing has been shown to be more effective in removing plaque," Friedman says, "and is recommended by periodontists ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/beauty-personal-care/should-you-bother-to-floss-your-teeth/#:~:text=flossing%20with%20a%20water-jet%20device%20may%20be%20especially%20helpful.%20%E2%80%9Cwater%20flossing%20has%20been%20shown%20to%20be%20more%20effective%20in%20removing%20plaque%2C%22%20friedman%20says%2C%20%22and%20is%20recommended%20by%20periodontists))
- Even sceptics of flossing say cleaning between your teeth is good for you. A Dutch periodontist who has conducted flossing studies says he uses a toothpick. ([source](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-36962667#:~:text=even%20sceptics%20of%20flossing%20say%20cleaning%20between%20your%20teeth%20is%20good%20for%20you.%20a%20dutch%20periodontist%20who%20has%20conducted%20flossing%20studies%20says%20he%20uses%20a%20toothpick.))
- If you have big gaps between your teeth, you don't need to worry about it ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/266x2q/why_are_americans_so_obsessed_with_flossing/#:~:text=if%20you%20have%20big%20gaps%20between%20your%20teeth%2C%20you%20don't%20need%20to%20worry%20about%20it))
- Flossing isn't just to remove plaque or whatever by scraping it away... it's actually also is to disrupt bacteria colonies that "settle" in your mouth, undisturbed, kind of like an anthill or something. And by flossing you're destroying all their colonies and stomping on all the anthills... you're not just "removing gunk". ([source](super_fake_clipboard))
  
## Flosses (to buy)

- All flosses clean effectively ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/toothbrushes/buying-guide/index.htm#:~:text=All%20flosses%20clean%20effectively))

## Mouthwash

_**Bottomline**_: Not going to use it. Seems like a super-optimizing thing that I don’t need if I do everything else correctly

- Don’t need it if you’re brushing and flossing correctly
- Can help with breath (could use it after lunch)
- Even if you did want to add it to your routine, it’d have to be after you brush your teeth, which washes away fluoride (so fluoride can no longer have its preventative effects
- The ingredients in each mouthwash formula vary slightly — different products work for different purposes.
- Research shows that mouthwash does help prevent plaque and gingivitis. But since formulas differ greatly and using mouthwash is tied closely to a good oral hygiene routine in general, it’s hard to definitively say how much it helps or which formula is best.
- Mouthwash kills bacteria by using antiseptic ingredients like alcohol, menthol, and eucalyptol. These ingredients get into the crevices between your teeth and hard-to-reach places like the very back of your mouth, killing the filmy bacteria that can collect there.
- If you have open sores or oral lesions in your mouth, you might want to try using mouthwash to kill bacteria and speed healing.
- Its job is mostly about making your mouth “feel” fresh. “You don’t need mouthwash, but if you enjoy it, or you have bad breath and feel it helps, then there’s no substantiated risks to rinsing once or twice a day,” he says.
- Biggest benefit is clean breath and feeling
- Has the ability to get into places your toothbrush doesn’t (top of mouth, back of cheeks, etc.)
- Some say don’t use after brushing, some say _do_ use after brushing to get the rest
  - Some even say use water instead (contradicting advice about on not rinsing after brushing)
  - “some dentifrice ingredients (like calcium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide) can form a complex with fluoride ions and reduce a mouthwash’s effectiveness. Therefore, vigorous rinsing with water may be recommended after brushing and before rinsing if these ingredients are present.”
- There are two basic kinds of mouthwashes, the kind that just temporarily freshens your breath (cosmetic) and the kind that addresses oral health problems (therapeutic). In general, products marketed as “mouthwashes” are cosmetic and “rinses” tend to be therapeutic, but this isn’t always the case.

## Notes

- Rinse your mouth after sugary or starchy snacks ([source](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/toothbrushes/buying-guide/index.htm#:~:text=rinse%20your%20mouth%20after%20sugary%20or%20starchy%20snacks))
- Rinse your mouth vigorously after eating anything
- Commonly said that **diet** is a big factor in long term oral hygiene/health
