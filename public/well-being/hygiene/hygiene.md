## Going without deodorant

_(in addition to no soap)_

**tl;dr** definitely will increase in bacteria, possibility going 4-5 months total could get rid of smell. deodorant probably better than adding soap back into mix (strips skin of oil); antiperspirant might be better

- one guy said the scent of pits went away after **4-5 months**
- some recommend **baking soda or bicarbonate**
- people say cutting dairy helps
  - some say cutting animal products
- one guy said `Plant based diet and green smoothies and I can skip the "deodorant" all together`
- took a look at reddit NoSoap subreddit
- Deodorant stones a thing -- natural deodorant

  - I find it easiest to towel off skipping my armpits and immediately use the stone. They need moisture for application. The stone can be slippery when wet so it is better to have wet/moist pits instead of wet slippery stone. If the thing hits the floor it will shatter in to tiny pieces.

  - Questionable if they're safe
- The groin smell reduction was unexpected and remarkable, and the entire nether region is clearly healthier, less moist, and less cheesy than ever before.
- "Deodorant is still required, as armpits are designed to generate significant smell. However, a single application of deodorant is sufficient to last for two days for light effort days such as an office job"
- a lot of people (that are privvy to the no soap movement) still use deodorant
  - some say they still use soap on pits (but don't specify if they use deodorant too)
- Anti-perspirants prevent or reduce sweating in the armpits and are the best way to prevent unpleasant odours - even if you wash with soap you still need these products. Although chemical in nature, most anti-perspirants are well tolerated and seldom cause problems.  There are prescription-strength variants available for those with an excessive sweat problem.

## Notes

- Most people actually use way too much body wash. They fill up their entire palm, which is way more than the quarter-sized dollop that they actually need. ([source](https://puracy.com/blogs/wellness/4-tips-how-to-use-body-wash#:~:text=Most%20people%20actually%20use%20way%20too%20much%20body%20wash.%20They%20fill%20up%20their%20entire%20palm%2C%20which%20is%20way%20more%20than%20the%20quarter-sized%20dollop%20that%20they%20actually%20need.))
- Another common myth is that you should use body wash all over. The reality, however, is that you can effectively clean most of your skin by simply rinsing it with water. ([source](https://puracy.com/blogs/wellness/4-tips-how-to-use-body-wash#:~:text=Another%20common%20myth%20is%20that%20you%20should%20use%20body%20wash%20all%20over.%20The%20reality%2C%20however%2C%20is%20that%20you%20can%20effectively%20clean%20most%20of%20your%20skin%20by%20simply%20rinsing%20it%20with%20water.))
  - “Reserve soap and shower gel for your underarm and groin regions – unless your skin is visibly dirty from activities like gardening or working in the garage.” ([source](https://puracy.com/blogs/wellness/4-tips-how-to-use-body-wash#:~:text=%E2%80%9CReserve%20soap%20and%20shower%20gel%20for%20your%20underarm%20and%20groin%20regions%20%E2%80%93%20unless%20your%20skin%20is%20visibly%20dirty%20from%20activities%20like%20gardening%20or%20working%20in%20the%20garage.%E2%80%9D))
- Hot water can quickly strip away your skin's natural oils, leading to drier, flakier skin ([source](https://puracy.com/blogs/wellness/shower-routine-for-healthy-skin#:~:text=hot%20water%20can%20quickly%20strip%20away%20your%20skin's%20natural%20oils%2C%20leading%20to%20drier%2C%20flakier%20skin))
  - Flushing or redness indicates that your water is too hot. ([source](https://puracy.com/blogs/wellness/shower-routine-for-healthy-skin#:~:text=Flushing%20or%20redness%20indicates%20that%20your%20water%20is%20too%20hot.))
- Proper shampooing not only removes oil and hair product buildup but it also helps cut down on oil that gets trapped in pores. Place a quarter-sized amount of shampoo into your hands, work it into your scalp along the roots. Don’t forget to pay attention behind your ears and along your nape (usually the oiliest area). Depending on your length of hair, scrub between 30 and 60 seconds before rinsing.

- Pat – don’t rub – your skin dry! Doing so will help maintain moisture while causing fewer issues down the line (we're looking at you, wrinkles).

- Body soap makes you smell fresh and clean short-term, but it essentially enables the problem it’s supposed to solve ([source](https://repeller.com/giving-up-soap/#:~:text=Body%20soap%20makes%20you%20smell%20fresh%20and%20clean%20short-term%2C%20but%20it%20essentially%20enables%20the%20problem%20it%E2%80%99s%20supposed%20to%20solve))
- For most people, shampooing the hair is not necessary for good health. Just rinsing the hair with water a few times a week will remove most visible dirt and debris. The decision about how frequently to wash the hair is a cosmetic one based on personal preference. ([source](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319848#:~:text=For%20most%20people%2C%20shampooing%20the%20hair%20is%20not%20necessary%20for%20good%20health.%20Just%20rinsing%20the%20hair%20with%20water%20a%20few%20times%20a%20week%20will%20remove%20most%20visible%20dirt%20and%20debris.%20The%20decision%20about%20how%20frequently%20to%20wash%20the%20hair%20is%20a%20cosmetic%20one%20based%20on%20personal%20preference.))
- DHT is the main culprit in hair loss, and some shampoos can help to combat this. Search for products containing 1-2% ketoconazole ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/23/seven-ways-to-avoid-hair-loss#:~:text=DHT%20is%20the%20main%20culprit%20in%20hair%20loss%2C%20and%20some%20shampoos%20can%20help%20to%20combat%20this.%20Search%20for%20products%20containing%201-2%25%20ketoconazole))
- If not using shampoo, may need less hair product
- Cutting animal products eliminated body odor, oily skin and acne among other things ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoPoo/comments/8k8myb/does_anyone_do_no_soap_as_well/#:~:text=cutting%20animal%20products%20eliminated%20body%20odor%2C%20oily%20skin%20and%20acne%20among%20other%20things))
