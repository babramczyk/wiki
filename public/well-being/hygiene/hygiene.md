## Notes

- Most people actually use way too much body wash. They fill up their entire palm, which is way more than the quarter-sized dollop that they actually need.

- Another common myth is that you should use body wash all over. The reality, however, is that you can effectively clean most of your skin by simply rinsing it with water. ([source](https://puracy.com/blogs/wellness/4-tips-how-to-use-body-wash#:~:text=Another%20common%20myth%20is%20that%20you%20should%20use%20body%20wash%20all%20over.%20The%20reality%2C%20however%2C%20is%20that%20you%20can%20effectively%20clean%20most%20of%20your%20skin%20by%20simply%20rinsing%20it%20with%20water.))
  - “Reserve soap and shower gel for your underarm and groin regions – unless your skin is visibly dirty from activities like gardening or working in the garage.” ([source](https://puracy.com/blogs/wellness/4-tips-how-to-use-body-wash#:~:text=%E2%80%9CReserve%20soap%20and%20shower%20gel%20for%20your%20underarm%20and%20groin%20regions%20%E2%80%93%20unless%20your%20skin%20is%20visibly%20dirty%20from%20activities%20like%20gardening%20or%20working%20in%20the%20garage.%E2%80%9D))
- Hot water can quickly strip away your skin's natural oils, leading to drier, flakier skin ([source](https://puracy.com/blogs/wellness/shower-routine-for-healthy-skin#:~:text=hot%20water%20can%20quickly%20strip%20away%20your%20skin's%20natural%20oils%2C%20leading%20to%20drier%2C%20flakier%20skin))
  - Flushing or redness indicates that your water is too hot. ([source](https://puracy.com/blogs/wellness/shower-routine-for-healthy-skin#:~:text=Flushing%20or%20redness%20indicates%20that%20your%20water%20is%20too%20hot.))
- Proper shampooing not only removes oil and hair product buildup but it also helps cut down on oil that gets trapped in pores. Place a quarter-sized amount of shampoo into your hands, work it into your scalp along the roots. Don’t forget to pay attention behind your ears and along your nape (usually the oiliest area). Depending on your length of hair, scrub between 30 and 60 seconds before rinsing.

- Pat – don’t rub – your skin dry! Doing so will help maintain moisture while causing fewer issues down the line (we're looking at you, wrinkles). ([source](https://puracy.com/blogs/wellness/shower-routine-for-healthy-skin#:~:text=pat%20%E2%80%93%20don%E2%80%99t%20rub%20%E2%80%93%20your%20skin%20dry!%20Doing%20so%20will%20help%20maintain%20moisture%20while%20causing%20fewer%20issues%20down%20the%20line%20(we're%20looking%20at%20you%2C%20wrinkles).))
- Body soap makes you smell fresh and clean short-term, but it essentially enables the problem it’s supposed to solve ([source](https://repeller.com/giving-up-soap/#:~:text=Body%20soap%20makes%20you%20smell%20fresh%20and%20clean%20short-term%2C%20but%20it%20essentially%20enables%20the%20problem%20it%E2%80%99s%20supposed%20to%20solve))
- For most people, shampooing the hair is not necessary for good health. Just rinsing the hair with water a few times a week will remove most visible dirt and debris. The decision about how frequently to wash the hair is a cosmetic one based on personal preference. ([source](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319848#:~:text=For%20most%20people%2C%20shampooing%20the%20hair%20is%20not%20necessary%20for%20good%20health.%20Just%20rinsing%20the%20hair%20with%20water%20a%20few%20times%20a%20week%20will%20remove%20most%20visible%20dirt%20and%20debris.%20The%20decision%20about%20how%20frequently%20to%20wash%20the%20hair%20is%20a%20cosmetic%20one%20based%20on%20personal%20preference.))
- DHT is the main culprit in hair loss, and some shampoos can help to combat this. Search for products containing 1-2% ketoconazole ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/23/seven-ways-to-avoid-hair-loss#:~:text=DHT%20is%20the%20main%20culprit%20in%20hair%20loss%2C%20and%20some%20shampoos%20can%20help%20to%20combat%20this.%20Search%20for%20products%20containing%201-2%25%20ketoconazole))
- If not using shampoo, may need less hair product
