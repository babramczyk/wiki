## How to apply

- As a general rule of thumb, always apply in relatively small scoops and use as many as needed rather than using a couple of very large scoops. This will help ensure the product is distributed evenly through the hair.

- As far as damp vs dry vs wet, start by applying to towel dried hair and experimenting for yourself.

- Straight/thin hair can be styled dry. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pomade/wiki/index#:~:text=straight%2Fthin%20hair%20can%20be%20styled%20dry.))
- With regard to **how much to use**
  - Push your comfort zone and see what you like. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pomade/wiki/index#:~:text=push%20your%20comfort%20zone%20and%20see%20what%20you%20like.))

## UWB

- Supposedly the cool new type of pomade
- “Think of Shear Revival Crystal Lake and O'Douds Water Based Pomade when thinking about Unorthodox Water Based Pomades.”
- Like oil based, but easier to wash out

## Notes

- everyone hates Suavecito
- Murray’s and Reuzel recommended a few times
- Some sites saying don’t use it everyday
  - I think these sites are assuming I’m using a ton of it, which I don’t
- Multiple sites / users saying petroleum-based is bad
  - Could lead to hair loss
- UWB - Unorthodox Waterbased Pomade
- OWB - Orthodox Waterbased Pomade
- Oil based pomades can lead to “scalp acne”, where you get pimples
