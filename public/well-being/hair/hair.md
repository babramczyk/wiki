## Avoiding baldness

**tl;dr:** Eat healthy, avoid stress. Some supplements an option. Sinclair and co. could change the game one day.

- Obesity accelerates hair loss by harming hair stem cells ([source](https://twitter.com/davidasinclair/status/1408465228732436490?lang=en#:~:text=obesity%20accelerates%20hair%20loss%20by%20harming%20hair%20stem%20cells))
- Fill your plate with foods rich in vitamin A, such as sweet potatoes, sweet peppers, and spinach, just to name a few.

- By age 40, about half of all men will experience hair loss due to hereditary conditions like androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness).

- If you want to prevent hair loss, you can also prioritize a diet high in healthy proteins, Omega-3 fatty acids, and fresh fruits and vegetables. If you’re trying to prevent baldness, you can take vitamins such as iron, biotin, vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc.

- Supplements: Propecia, rogaine
- Can't really be prevented yet -- can only be slowed
- Avoid excessive use of hair gels and try more natural styling products, which contain fewer chemicals.

- Some believe that scalp inflammation can result in miniaturisation of the hair follicles and thinning hair. ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/23/seven-ways-to-avoid-hair-loss#:~:text=some%20believe%20that%20scalp%20inflammation%20can%20result%20in%20miniaturisation%20of%20the%20hair%20follicles%20and%20thinning%20hair.))
- Some studies have suggested that scalp massage has the potential to increase hair density by improving blood circulation to the scalp and hair follicles, as well as increasing the activity of genes known to promote hair growth. An additional benefit is that massage helps to lower stress levels, another factor relating to hair loss.
