## Hoarse throat

- Gargling with warm salt water can help
- Whispering is bad -- it sends air through the vocal chords, which dries them out
- Ice cream and cough drops numb the pain (the throat feels better), but doesn't heal anything

## Notes

- Inflammation
  - Inflammation refers to your body's process of fighting against things that harm it, such as infections, injuries, and toxins, in an attempt to heal itself. When something damages your cells, your body releases chemicals that trigger a response from your immune system.
  - Why is it seen as bad sometimes?
    - Inflammation plays a central role in healing, but left to run wild, this process can lead to arthritis, heart disease, and Alzheimer's. Inflammation is like a fire in your body you cannot see or feel.
- Common theme in neuroscience discussions: **can't control the body with the body, vice-versa**
  - Leverage the other to control these
- You should sip water slowly, two to three ounces at a time, throughout the day. If you drink too fast, you risk diluting your blood, which may cause faster excretion of water by the kidneys ([source](https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/content/story/youre-chugging-water-hydrate-youre-wrong#:~:text=You%20should%20sip%20water%20slowly%2C%20two%20to%20three%20ounces%20at%20a%20time%2C%20throughout%20the%20day.%20If%20you%20drink%20too%20fast%2C%20you%20risk%20diluting%20your%20blood%2C%20which%20may%20cause%20faster%20excretion%20of%20water%20by%20the%20kidneys))
- One more thing to completely avoid post dinner is working out. It not only affects our digestion but also postpone our sleep time.

- go for a brisk walk or indulge in any form of workout half an hour prior to your meal. It takes a lot of energy from our body and leaves it with ample room for the energy to be restored after a sumptuous meal. This drastically reduces the chances of your food getting converted into fat as the food we consume is used by the body for energy. In simple terms, working out before meal amplifies your bodyâ€™s metabolism which leads to better burn up of calories once we consume and digest our food.

- you can indulge in some leisurely walk post meal just to get rid of the bloating feeling ([source](https://www.pnbmetlife.com/articles/health/myth-buster-should-we-brisk-walk.html#:~:text=you%20can%20indulge%20in%20some%20leisurely%20walk%20post%20meal%20just%20to%20get%20rid%20of%20the%20bloating%20feeling))
