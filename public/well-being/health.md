## Hoarse throat

- Gargling with warm salt water can help
- Whispering is bad -- it sends air through the vocal chords, which dries them out
- Ice cream and cough drops numb the pain (the throat feels better), but doesn't heal anything

## Notes

- Inflammation
  - Inflammation refers to your body's process of fighting against things that harm it, such as infections, injuries, and toxins, in an attempt to heal itself. When something damages your cells, your body releases chemicals that trigger a response from your immune system.
  - Why is it seen as bad sometimes?
    - Inflammation plays a central role in healing, but left to run wild, this process can lead to arthritis, heart disease, and Alzheimer's. Inflammation is like a fire in your body you cannot see or feel.
- Common theme in neuroscience discussions: **can't control the body with the body, vice-versa**
  - Leverage the other to control these
