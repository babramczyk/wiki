## Setting the clock

Much of our biological system and clock is anchored by the neurons in our eyes receiving light for sunrise and sunset.

- Getting this light tells the body when to be awake and when to sleep
- Getting sunlight-like light early will, after 2-3 days, result in you being more wakeful earlier
  - Also has effects on other things, like mood, health, etc.

### How it works/how to get it

- The light needs to be similar to sunrise/sunset for it to be properly effective
  - Blue light in the morning is actually good, since it's like the sun
    - Still, don't look at painful blue light ever (i.e. if you feel the need to blink)
  - The angle of the sun at sunrise/sunset has an effect
- Once you start getting sunrise-like light, the body sets a "clock" for 12-14 hours, after which it starts releasing Melatonin to induce sleep
- Low or very dim lights will not affect this clock very much (e.g. candles, lights on the floor)
  - Example of a scientist "turning his home into a cave" at night to help with this
- "Get outside" to get this light and exercise early in the day
  - The light taken in through a window is ~50x less than if you were outside
- The amount of time depends on where you live (because of the sun exposure
  - But basically get outside at sunrise and sunset
  - "2-10 minutes" should be enough for most people/places
- The process is subconcious -- so it even works for blind people, since the light still gets into their eyes
  - Fun fact: The holes in the skull for eyes developed not for vision, but initially for this intake of light. Snakes, for examples, have holes in their skull purely for this purpose
