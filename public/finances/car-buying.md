# Car Buying

## Notes

- Beware of long (i.e. 7 year) loans
  - Cars depreciate in value, unlike houses
  - You end up paying for a car that has no value or less value than what you're paying
- Get pre-approved for a loan before going in
  - So that you know your interest rate
  - The dealership can bully you into a higher interest rate if you don't come knowing what actual interest rate you can get
    - i.e. they might point out some recent late payments and give a higher rate
- When you go to a dealership, only talk about price
  - Other information (you're trading in, what loan you want) can and will be used against you by the salesman
- After you get through the salesman, you still have to go back to some office to finance it. At that point is where you really have to be careful
  - They try to add a bunch of add-ons
    - **Don't buy the add-ons**. They make them sound really good, but they're overpriced. And you can always get them elsewhere
  - They add fees
