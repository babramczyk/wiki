## Notes

- Select smaller onions when cooking for two
- Select smaller potatoes
  - Taste better \(more moisture and flavor, creamier texture\)
  - Better when cooking for two
- Chop your own garlic
  - Tastes better than pre-made garlic
  - Keeps for weeks
- Use a microplane for zesting
- Serve meals on warmed plates
  - Keeps food hot while eating
  - 90 seconds in microwave
- Before you start cooking
  - Read the recipe — understand the high level steps
  - Get out all ingredients
  - Read through steps, and plan the prep
  - More relaxed and accurate cooking this way
- Invest in a sharp knife, and sharpening steel
- Slice food thinly for faster cooking
  - In order for fresh vegetables and meats to cook quickly, it’s necessary to cut them into thin slices so that the heat can penetrate
  - Make cuts according to recipe directions
- Oils
  - Extra Virgin Olive Oil \(EVOO\) for salad dressings and uncooked foods
  - Regular Olive Oil for cooking
  - These are the healthiest with flavor \(a little more expensive\)
  - EVOO has low smoke point, so can only be used up to ~medium on stovetop
  - Regular olive oil can be used up to medium high
  - Anything else, and you’ll need something like vegetable, canola, avocado oil for their lower smoke points
- Buy a box of kosher salt and put it in a ramekin near the stove for easy use
- Freshly ground black pepper is more robust than packaged ground peppers
  - Buy a pepper mill and fill with whole black peppercorns
  - Adds flavor to everything — add as much as you want
