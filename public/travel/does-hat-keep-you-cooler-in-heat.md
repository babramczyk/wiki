# Does wearing a hat keep you cooler in the heat?

Wanted to understand this, as if I'm e.g. traveling, I want to know whether the hat blocking the sun helps enough to offset the heat it's keeping in just by being on your head.

Couldn't find any real verdict or convictions. Seems like it depends on a few factors, and personal experience. Personally, I _think_ they make me a little hotter, but I'm not sure. Off to get personal experience myself ðŸ™‚

## Notes

- If you do hear a hat, wear a mesh/breathable one ideally
- Also preferable to have a light-colored hat, to reflect sunlight
- Using a running visor. It keeps the sun and sweat out of my eyes, but allows my head to "breathe".
