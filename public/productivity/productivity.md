# Productivity

## Notes

- When you're most alert, best to do things you already know how to do. "Linear implementation" (source: Huberman)
- Mid-morning is often when many people are in peak alertness
- Creativity is often best when calm or slightly drowsy
- Background noise / music (source: Huberman)
  - Good if we're not alert (a lot of things going on around us will make our body on high alert)
  - Bad if we're already alert (will make you too distracted / alert)
- The goal is to aim for a good balance of "go" and "no go". Action and suppression (source: Huberman)
  - Action to be motivated to get things done
  - Suppression to not get distracted (by phone, or meaningless to-dos)
  - These pathways are very consuming. After a while, discipline starts to wane
- Exercising earlier in the day helps us get up earlier, and helps us stay alert later in the day. More energy in the day in general (source: Huberman)
  - If the exercise is very consuming, you might crash after you have a meal
- Fast and low carb states lend themselves to alertness (source: Huberman)
  - Food makes you sleepy in general
    - The blood is directed towards the gut
    - Energy spent on digestion
- A bit of starch at lunch if highly consuming exercise done in the morning (source: Huberman)
- Biologically programmed spike in alertness 60 minutes before bed (source: Huberman)
  - Historically, humans needed to gather resources before sleep
  - Passes after 45-60 minutes
  - Don't worry about this -- instead, do mundane tasks in this time (e.g. cleaning)
