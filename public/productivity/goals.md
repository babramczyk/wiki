# Goals

## Notes from [Huberman goals podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6cO0BC9EEedrKhxQtjuo80?si=e75373ccc9fb4e0a)

- Focusing on a goal line visually helps. Study found that participants performed ~20% better and with ~20% less effort when focusing on the goal line they were running towards 
  - **This is for short term goals**. As other notes show, visualizing for long term goals doesn't help too much
- Multitasking has a use
  - Study showed that on average humans only actually hold their full attention for **3 minutes**
  - Multitasking activates norepinephrine / adrenaline. So it can be good when _about_ to start focus on a goal **if you need activation / adrenaline**
- Focusing visually on a single point in space for 30-60 seconds enhances ability to focus mentally, prepares brain for focus 
  - So good before starting on a goal **if you need disciplined focus** (at least that's my understanding of the difference between this and multitasking before focus)
- Cold showers can provide 2.5x in long term dopamine release (he mentioned a study I think)
- Visualizing successful outcome of goal is a little helpful, but only at start of trying to achieve a goal and maybe a few times during
  - But visualizing _what failure might look like_ is actually far more impactful for determining if the goal is successful
- A goal needs to be not too easy, but not impossible
  - More likely you'll give up easier if it's either
  - So, a _challenging_, _attainable_ goal
- Big difference between when you decided to pursue a goal vs feel like you're being forced into it. You attain more benefits, dopamine if you feel like you're the one who decided to do it
  - e.g. rat study where some rats were motivated to exercise, and others were forced to. The ones motivated to experienced positive health benefits. The ones who didn't actually experienced _negative_ health impact
- It's important to assess progress on a goal. He mentioned once a week is a good starting point.
- Experiencing rewards when you complete progress towards a goal help increase chance you'll do it again (dopamine release)
